# Deltek Open PlanÂ® Developer's Guide

*December 20, 2020*

---

## Overview

With Deltek Open Plan's project management tools, you can provide your organization with reliable estimates and solutions for long and short-term resource and budget allocations. Simplify manual processes with rapid data entry, quickly share and update project plan information through Project Portfolio Management (PPM) integration, and ensure projects get the resources they need.

## Integration

### Open Plan OLE Automation

OLE automation is a feature of the Windows operating systems family that allows different Windows applications to share data and functionality. OLE automation lets you easily extend the capabilities of Open Plan with powerful, low-maintenance solutions designed with the tools that best suit your needs and abilities.

One of the most powerful features in Open Plan is its support of the robust and flexible technology of OLE automation. Open Plan is designed as an OLE server application, exposing a variety of objects, properties, and methods for use with other Windows applications such as Visual FoxPro, Visual Basic, Microsoft Excel, and many others.

This document discusses the Open Plan object hierarchy and contains information about objects and collections, properties, and methods. The document concludes with tables of Open Plan date formats and examples of incorporating OLE automation in your project.

#### Objects

The fundamental unit of data or functionality exposed by a server application is called an object. Objects can have constituent parts that are themselves objects. Objects in Open Plan can include the following items:

- The Open Plan application
- A project or collection of projects
- An activity or collection of activities
- Resource definitions or assignments
- Project codes and code files
- Calendar information

#### Collections

Some objects are collections of other objects. The names of collection objects are usually the plural form of the names of the objects they contain. These collection objects can be manipulated in the same way as other objects. Most collections provide methods for retrieving, counting, adding, or deleting individual members from the collection. Collection objects in Open Plan can include:

- A collection of activity records
- A collection of barchart views
- A collection of resource description records

#### Properties

Each object created in Open Plan has a set of properties that represent the specific attributes of that object. Some objects have values that can be changed while others have values that can only be retrieved. The following are examples of object properties:

- A field in an activity record
- The number of activities in a project
- The state of a window or view

#### Methods

Many objects in Open Plan have methods as well as properties. Unlike object properties, which are attributes that you can set or return, object methods are actions that you instruct the object to perform. Methods available for objects in Open Plan include:

- Adding an activity
- Performing time analysis
- Displaying a view
- Opening a project
- Minimizing a window
- Setting a filter

### Accessing OLE Automation Objects

Open Plan OLE Automation objects can be easily accessed with a variety of programming environments and client applications. The decision of which tool to use is left solely to the user. Deltek's OLE sample code is written in Microsoft's Visual Basic, which is an excellent tool for both beginners and experienced users to create simple, yet powerful, OLE client applications. This section describes the steps and syntax for accessing Open Plan OLE Automation objects with Visual Basic.

The first step for an external application to access objects belonging to Open Plan is to get the Open Plan application object. The following Visual Basic code is an example of retrieving the Open Plan application object. (In Visual Basic, a line of code that begins with an apostrophe is a comment.)

```vb
'Declare the Open Plan Application Object variable
Dim OPCreateApplication33 As Object
'Assign the Application object variable
Set OPCreateApplication33 = CreateObject("opp.application")
```

After retrieving the Open Plan application object, its properties and methods then can be accessed in the following ways:

- Getting a property of an object
- Setting a property of an object
- Executing a method of an object

#### Getting an Object Property

A property of an object is retrieved by setting a variable equal to the object variable, followed by a period (.), and followed by a property name.

**Syntax:**
```vb
Variable = ObjectVariable.PropertyName
```

**Example:**
```vb
Dim MyActivities As Object
Dim ActivityCount As Long
ActivityCount = MyActivities.Count
```

#### Setting an Object Property

A property of an object is set by setting the object variable, followed by a period (.), and followed by a property name equal to a variable that represents the values of the property.

**Syntax:**
```vb
ObjectVariable.PropertyName = Variable
```

**Example:**
```vb
Dim MyActivities As Object
Dim ActID As String
ActID = MyActivities.ID
```

#### Executing an Object Method

An OLE Automation method can either use no parameters, or one or more parameters. It can return either nothing or a value. For methods that return a value, a variable can be assigned to the returning value by placing the variable on the left side of the equal sign (=). Some methods return objects. For these methods, the returned value is set to an object variable.

**Methods with no parameters**

**Syntax:**
```vb
ObjectVariable.MethodName
```

**Example:**
```vb
MyCodeView.Minimize
```

**Methods with one or more parameters**

**Syntax:**
```vb
ObjectVariable.MethodName Parameter1, Parameter2
```

**Example:**
```vb
MyProject.ResourceSchedule "Time Limited", True
```

**Methods that return a value**

**Syntax:**
```vb
Variable = ObjectVariable.MethodName(Parameter1, Parameter2)
```

**Example:**
```vb
SuppressInListsFlag = AResource.Getfield("NO_LIST")
```

**Methods that return an object**

**Syntax:**
```vb
ObjectVariable1 = ObjectVariable2.MethodName.Item(Parameter1)
```

**Example:**
```vb
Set MyCalendarFile = OPCreateApplication33.Calendars.Item("MYCAL")
```

### Modifying Existing Applications for Use with Open Plan 8.x

Because of features that were added to Open Plan 8.x, some applications may have to be modified before you can use them with Open Plan.

#### Objects, Properties, and Methods No Longer Supported

Some objects, properties, and methods are no longer supported in Open Plan 8.x. Objects not supported include:

- OPFCProcesses
- OPFCStructures

Properties no longer supported in Open Plan 8.x are:

- OPPFormat
- ResidueFile

Methods not supported in Open Plan 8.x are:

- FileOpenSpecialOpenPlan
- OpenSpecialODBC
- GlobalDir
- Rights
- Processes
- Structures

#### Naming Conventions

Applications using early binding need to be modified to use the new application object's name. OPCreateApplication is also referred to as OPApplication object in this guide.

#### Security Features

A security feature added to Open Plan 8.x requires users to login upon launching the application. For this reason, automation applications that are intended to launch Open Plan must call the Login method immediately after instantiating the Open Plan application.

If a user's security permissions in Open Plan do not permit the use of a given feature, that feature will not be available for use by automation applications. Instead of disabling tab commands in Deltek EPM Security Administrator, set the menu items to invisible and leave them enabled. The user will not be able to access them, but automation applications will.

#### Add-Ins Tab

In Open Plan 8.x, more parameters are available to use with applications added to the Add-Ins tab. These parameters can be used to return context-specific data to your application or to control how an Add-Ins tab tool is launched.

The data returned by Open Plan's special command line parameters in the Add-Ins tab is wrapped in quotes. It may be necessary to modify your applications to handle this.

**Attention:** For a list of the command line parameters and information about the Add-Ins tab, see Open Plan Configuration Files.

The following sample VB6 code shows how to access the method. OAFields::GetFieldInfoInXMLFormat returns an XML string. The Boolean parameter for the method indicates whether the caller wants "full" (True) or "abbreviated" (False) output. An explanation of the output follows the code sample.

```vba
bResult = myApp.FileOpen("CLEAN", "PROJECT", "Exclusive")
If bResult Then
    Set myProject = myApp.Projects(1)
    If Not myProject Is Nothing Then
        Set myActivities = myProject.Activities
        If Not myActivities Is Nothing Then
            myFields = myActivities.Fields
            If Not myFields Is Nothing Then
                sFields = myFields.GetFieldInfoInXMLFormat(True)
                Set myFields = Nothing
            End If
            Set MyActivities = Nothing
        End If
        myProject.ShutWOSave
        Set MyProject = Nothing
    End If
End If
```

"Abbreviated" output gives you the following:

**Name** (e.g. "ACT_ID")

**UserName** (e.g. "Activity Id")

**Type** (e.g., "HIER"). The following is a list of types:

- UNKN (unknown)
- TEXT
- MEMO (e.g., a note field)
- CODE
- INTE (integer)
- DBLE (double)
- DATE (start date)
- FDAT (finish date)
- DURA (duration)
- HIER, HIEI (hierarchies). The second type indicates specifically that the hierarchy is defined as case-insensitive, although in practice, OP treats all hierarchical data as case-insensitive.
- GUID (e.g., "ACT_UID")
- DSPC (dayspec)
- SHFT (calendar shift)

Additionally, there are a number of enumerated types. I can provide a list of these if desired. One example is the relationship type field, whose database type is "RELT".

"Full" output gives you the above, plus:

**DBTYPE** (database type). Values are the following:

- EMPTY (used internally for the results of calculated fieldsâcalculated field results are not stored in the database, so they don't really have a DBTYPE)
- STR (string)
- I4 (integer)
- R8 (double)
- DATE
- TIMESTAMP
- IUNKNOWN

**FieldType**. Values are the following:

- CLC (calculated field)
- UDT (user field of type date or finish date)
- UNM (user field of type double)
- UTX (user field of type text)
- NTX (a note or memo field)
- CRA (a code field)
- UDU (user field of type duration)
- UDF (user field that is something other than one of the above)
- DBT (neither a calculated field nor a user field)

**IsEditable** ("Yes" or "No")

**Length** (maximum length of fieldâFor non-text items, the length field may refer to the display length when the data is transformed into a string)

**Scale** (number of decimal places)

# Examples

## Constructing Filter Strings

The OPFilter object's Add method and Expression properties, and the OPActivities object's SetFilterTo method all require a filter string as a parameter. These filter strings can be quite complex, using the same functions and syntax available for use in Open Plan's calculated fields. Valid operators for Open Plan's data types are as follows:

| Operator | Enumerations | Booleans | Strings | Dates | Durations | Numerics |
|----------|--------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| BETWEEN() | | | X | X | X | X |
| CONTAINS() | | | X | | X | X |
| = | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| >= | X | | X | X | X | X |
| > | X | | X | X | X | X |
| IS_EMPTY | | | X | X | | |
| <= | X | | X | X | X | X |
| < | X | | X | X | X | X |
| NOT_BETWEEN() | | | X | X | X | X |
| NOT_CONTAINS() | | | X | | X | X |
| NOT_EMPTY | | | X | X | | |
| <> | X | X | X | X | X | X |

Literal dates should be enclosed in curly braces {}. Literal strings should be enclosed in quotes (single or double). Literal durations should be enclosed in piping symbols | |. If the duration identifier (m, w, d, h, t) is not specified, the default duration unit will be assumed. Enumerated or Boolean values should be enclosed in square brackets [ ].

Sometimes an enumerated value can apply to more than one field. For example, [Complete] can apply to the Computed Status (COMPSTAT) field as well as to the Progress Type (PROGTYPE) field. To avoid errors caused by ambiguous enumerated values, use the following data type abbreviations that clearly identify the desired enumeration:

| Data Type Abbreviation | Open Plan Field | Open Plan Label |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ACTS | COMPSTAT | Computed Status |
| ACTT | ACT_TYPE | Activity Type |
| BOOL | OUTOFSEQ | Boolean |
| CRIT | CRITICAL | Critical Flag |
| DIST | DSHAPE | Duration Distribution Shape |
| EVTE | EVT | Earned Value Technique |
| LOGI | LOGICFLAG | Activity Logic Flag |
| PRJS | OPSTAT | Project Status |
| PROG | PROGTYPE | Progress Type |
| RELT | RELTYPE | Relationship Type |
| REST | RES_TYPE | Res. Type |
| RESC | RES_CLASS | Resource Class |
| RSCL | RSCLASS | R/S Type |
| RSCL | COMP_RS_C | Scheduled Actions |
| TARG | TARGFTYPE | Target Finish Type |
| TARG | TARGSTYPE | Target Start Type |

For example, when building a filter you might want to specify that the Computed Status is complete. In this case, you would use COMPSTAT = [ACTS.Complete].

Another way to avoid ambiguity with enumerated values is to convert the enumeration to a string. Again, to specify that the Computed Status is complete, you would use str(COMPSTAT) = "Complete".

The BETWEEN(), CONTAINS(), NOT_BETWEEN(), and NOT_CONTAINS() operators are always followed by an expression enclosed in parentheses. There cannot be a space between the operator and the left parenthesis.

The logical operators .and., .or., and .not. may be used to link multiple expressions. The .not. operator is always used in conjunction with the .and. operator, as follows: .and. .not.

The following examples are all valid filter strings:

```
ACT_TYPE = [ACTT.ASAP]
ACT_TYPE = [ACTT.ASAP] .or. ACT_TYPE = [ACTT.ALAP]
str(ACT_TYPE) CONTAINS("Subproject")
str(ACT_TYPE) NOT_CONTAINS("Subproject")
DESCRIPTION BETWEEN("A", "D") .and. .not. EFDATE = {12/31/99 16:00}
ORIG_DUR = |17|
ORIG_DUR NOT_BETWEEN(|1d|, |5d|)
USER_NUM02 <> LEVEL(C1)
```

## Excel Macro Example

The following listing is an example of an Excel macro written in Visual Basic for Applications. This macro, LoadStatusFromOPP(), automatically launches Open Plan, imports activity data from a specific project into an existing spreadsheet, and then closes Open Plan.

```vb
Sub LoadStatusFromOPP()

'Declare objects and variables

Dim OPApp As Object
'OPCreateApplication33 object
Dim OPProject As Object
' OPProject object
Dim OPAct As Object
'OPActivities object
Dim OPActRec As Object
'OPActivity object
Dim iCurrProj As Integer
'Project count from OP
Dim i As Integer
'Increment activity count
Dim NumActs As Integer
'Activity count from OP
Dim CurRow As Integer



'Create the application object and suppress the OP window

Set OPApp = GetObject("","opp.application")

OPApp.Minimize

'Load project

OPApp.FileOpen "pharmacy", "Project", "Exclusive"



'Define project and activity object variables

iCurrProj = OPApp.Projects.Count

Set OPProject = OPApp.Projects(iCurrProj)

Set OPAct = OPProject.Activities



'Create a variable for the number of activities in the project

NumActs = OPAct.Count



'Read data from OP into spreadsheet


Call SetupSheet


CurRow = 2


For i = 1 to NumActs


Set OPActRec = OPAct.Item(i)



Cells(CurRow, 1).Value = OPActRec.ID



Cells(CurRow,2).Value = OPActRec.Description



Cells(CurRow,3).Value = OPActRec.EarlyStart



Cells(CurRow,4).Value = OPActRec.EarlyFinish


CurRow = CurRow + 1

Next

'Close project and reclaim memory from objects
Finish:
OPProject.Shut
Set OPActRec = Nothing
Set OPAct = Nothing
Set OPProject = Nothing
Set OPApp = Nothing

Range("A1").Select
End Sub

Sub StartDemo()

Call LoadStatusFromOPP
End Sub

Sub Auto_Open()

Call ClearSheet
End Sub
```

## Early Binding

You can use either "early" or "late" binding to start an Automation session. Prior to version 2.0c, all Visual Basic code using Open Plan's automation objects used late binding to communicate with the Open Plan application. Late binding uses either the GetObject or CreateObject function to initialize Open Plan. Each object is then declared as a generic Object-type variable. For example, the following code sets an object to the Open Plan program, which is the highest level object in the Open Plan object model. All late-bound Automation code must first define an Opp.Application object in order to access any of the other objects below that.

```vb
Sub LateBound()

'Declare objects and variables

Dim OPCreateApplication33 As Object
Dim OPProjects As Object
Dim OPProject As Object
    
'Get the OPCreateApplication33 object

Set OPCreateApplication33 = GetObject("", "opp.application")
'Get an OPProject object from the OPProjects collection

Set OPProjects = OPCreateApplication33.Projects

Set OPProject = OPProjects.Item(1)


'Using the Maximize method to Maximize the Project window
OPProject.Maximize



'Disassociate object variables to release resources

Set OPProject = Nothing

Set OPCreateApplication33 = Nothing
End Sub
```

Early binding also uses the GetObject or CreateObject function to initialize Open Plan, but each object is then declared as a specific type of object. Early binding has two main advantages. First, code using early binding runs faster than code using late binding. Second, Visual Basic can perform various type checking operations before an application is run, cutting down on potential errors in your finished code. To use early binding, you first need to reference the Open Plan type library. The methods for doing this will vary depending on your programming environment.

The following code is an example of using early binding to initialize Open Plan.

```vb
Sub EarlyBound30()
'Declare objects and variables
Dim OPCreateApplication33 As New OPP30.OPCreateApplication33
Dim OPProjects As OPP30.OPProjects
Dim OPProject As OPP30.OPProject

'Get an OPProject object from the OPProjects collection
Set OPProjects = OPCreateApplication33.Projects
Set OPProject = OPProjects.Item(1)


'Using the Maximize method to Maximize the Project window

OPProject.Maximize

'Disassociate object variables to release resources
Set OPProject = Nothing
Set OPProjects = Nothing
Set OPCreateApplication33 = Nothing
End Sub
```

Notice that the New keyword was used to create the Open Plan application object. This top-level object (OPCreateApplication33) is the only object permitted to be created using the New keyword, and this object must be created before any of the other objects can be created. It is not necessary to use the New keyword. If "New" is omitted, you must use CreateObject or GetObject to create the Open Plan application object, as shown in the following example.

```vb
Sub EarlyBound30_2()
'Declare objects and variables
Dim OPCreateApplication33 As OPP30.OPCreateApplication33
Dim OPProjects As OPP30.OPProjects

Dim OPProject As OPP30.OPProject

'Get the OPCreateApplication33 object
Set OPCreateApplication33 = CreateObject("opp.application")

'Get an OPProject object from the OPProjects collection
Set OPProjects = OPCreateApplication33.Projects
Set OPProject = OPProjects.Item(1)

'Using the Maximize method to Maximize the Project window
OPProject.Maximize

'Disassociate object variables to release resources
Set OPProject = Nothing
Set OPProjects = Nothing
Set OPCreateApplication33 = Nothing
End Sub
```

## Using the SetCrosstabDates Method

The following example shows how to use the SetCrosstabDates method to define the date array used by the GetEarnedValueCrosstabData and GetResourceCrosstabData methods. This method allows you to specify the dates used when generating earned value or resource crosstab data, similar to using a reporting calendar in Open Plan.

```vb
Sub NewTest()

'declare objects and variables

Dim OppApp As Object

Dim OppProject As Object

Dim OppProjResources As Object

Dim OppProjResource As Object

Dim MyDateArray As Variant

Dim MyFloatArray As Variant

Dim sExportFileName As String
Dim iFileNumber As Integer
Dim sDateArrayString As String
Dim x As Integer
Dim y As Integer
Dim z As Integer
Dim sResID As String
Dim Quote As String
Dim Comma As String
Dim sFloatArrayString As String

'get the application and the project
Set OppApp = CreateObject("opp.application")
Set OppProject = OppApp.Projects("clean")

Quote = Chr$(34)
Comma = ","

## Using the AssignCurrentFieldSet Method

The AssignCurrentFieldSet method is used to define a list of fields that can then be manipulated with the GetCurrentFields or SetCurrentFields methods. These methods make it possible to set or retrieve the values of several fields at one time, which can enhance the performance of automation applications.

The following example shows how to retrieve values using GetCurrentFields.

```vb
Sub m_GetCurrentFields()



'Declare objects and variables
Dim OPCreateApplication33 As Object
Dim OPProject As Object
Dim OPActivities As Object
Dim OPActivity As Object
Dim sFieldValues As String
Dim sFieldSet As String
Dim bSuccess As Boolean


'Get the OPCreateApplication33 object

Set OPCreateApplication33 = GetObject("", "opp.application")



'Get an OPProject object from the OPProjects collection

Set OPProject = OPCreateApplication33.Projects(1)

'Get the OPActivities collection from the OPProject object
Set OPActivities = OPProject.Activities

'Get the OPActivity object from the OPActivities collection
Set OPActivity = OPProject.Activities(1)

'Using the AssignCurrentFieldSet method to define the list of fields to be used
'by the GetCurrentFields & SetCurrentFields methods
sFieldSet = "TFDATE|TARGFTYPE"
bSuccess = OPActivities.AssignCurrentFieldSet(sFieldSet)
'The method returns a Boolean indicating if the method was successful
Debug.Print bSuccess

'Use the GetCurrentFields method to return the values for the fields specified
'with the AssignCurrentFieldSet method
sFieldValues = OPActivity.GetCurrentFields
Debug.Print sFieldValues

'Disassociate object variables to release resources
Set OPActivity = Nothing
Set OPActivities = Nothing
Set OPProject = Nothing
Set OPCreateApplication33 = Nothing

End Sub
```

The following example shows how to set values using SetCurrentFields.

```vb
Sub m_SetCurrentFields()
'Declare objects and variables
Dim OPCreateApplication33 As Object
Dim OPProject As Object
Dim OPActivities As Object
Dim OPActivity As Object
Dim sFieldValues As String
Dim sFieldSet As String
Dim bSuccess As Boolean

'Get the OPCreateApplication33 object
Set OPCreateApplication33 = GetObject("", "opp.application")
'Get an OPProject object from the OPProjects collection
Set OPProject = OPCreateApplication33.Projects(1)
'Get the OPActivities collection from the OPProject object
Set OPActivities = OPProject.Activities
'Get the OPActivity object from the OPActivities collection
Set OPActivity = OPProject.Activities(1)

'Using the AssignCurrentFieldSet method to define the list of fields to be used
'by the GetCurrentFields & SetCurrentFields methods
sFieldSet = "TFDATE|TARGFTYPE"
'The method returns a Boolean indicating if the method was successful
bSuccess = OPActivities.AssignCurrentFieldSet(sFieldSet)
Debug.Print bSuccess

'Use the SetCurrentFields method to return the values for the fields specified
'with the AssignCurrentFieldSet method
sFieldValues = "Fixed Target|12/31/2002 16:00"
bSuccess = OPActivity.SetCurrentFields(sFieldValues)
'The method returns a Boolean indicating if the method was successful
Debug.Print bSuccess
Debug.Print OPActivity.GetCurrentFields

'Disassociate object variables to release resources
Set OPActivity = Nothing
Set OPActivities = Nothing
Set OPProject = Nothing
Set OPCreateApplication33 = Nothing

End Sub
```

# Import and Export Facilities

Open Plan includes several facilities for importing and exporting project data:

- An import/export facility for MSP projects
- An import/export facility for Primavera P6 projects
- An export facility for IPMDAR projects
- A basic import facility capability for projects created with Primavera Project PlannerÂ® (P3 and XER)
- A customizable import/export facility based on user-defined scripts that can be used to transfer project data to and from a wide range of external applications.
- An import/export facility for XML documents

## Integration with Microsoft Project

You can use Open Plan's import and export interface to import Microsoft Project .mpp files and Project Server projects. The import facility provides a seamless integration with Microsoft's current standard data formats.

### Importing Microsoft Project or Project Server Data

You can display the first page of the Microsoft Project Import Wizard by clicking MS Project on the Integration tab Import menu group.

> **Note:** In order to import data into an existing project, the project and all of its ancillary files must first be opened in exclusive mode.

For more information see Importing and Exporting Project Data in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

> **Attention:** For more information about integrating with Microsoft Project, see Importing and Exporting Project Data Â» Microsoft Project Integration in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

### Exporting Open Plan Data to Microsoft Project or Project Server

You can export data from an Open Plan project to a Microsoft Project file or Project Server project. You can display the first page of the Microsoft Project Export Wizard by clicking MS Project on the Integration tab Export menu group.

Before you can export a project to Microsoft Project, it must first be saved as an Open Plan project.

### View Exported Data

If you want to review the data that was exported to Microsoft Project Professional or Server, add _KEEP_MSP_OUTPUT_FILES with a value of 1 to the System Preferences dialog box ( Â» Preferences Â» Application Â» Advanced tab). Open Plan creates .csv integration files and saves them to the Open Plan working folder, for example, Documents Â» Deltek Â» Open Plan Professional 8.5. Each file has a unique name that includes the Open Plan project name and a time stamp.

If the setting is enabled, the generated .csv files will remain in the folder until you delete them (disabling the setting will not delete accumulated files). You may want to periodically delete them to keep the folder size from becoming too large.

### Limitations When Using Project Server Directly for Import/Export

The following are limitations when you use Project Server directly for import or export:

- Project Server does not support external subprojects.
- Calendar limitations:
  - Local (non-enterprise) calendars cannot have an enterprise base calendar.
  - Calendar shift, working-day hours, and work weeks are not available.
  - Calendars cannot be assigned to tasks or resources.
- EVM (Earned Value Method) cannot be specified for tasks.
- Although the task Type field is read-only, Open Plan specifies a Fixed Duration default task type for the project.
- Resource time-phasing information is not available.
- Notes limitations:
  - Task notes may be assigned when the task is created, but task notes may not be subsequently added.
  - Resource notes cannot be created from Open Plan.
  - When a note contains special characters, it gets truncated before the first special character.
- The WBS field is read-only, both for new and existing tasks.
- The resource type (work, material, or cost) cannot be set for non-enterprise (local) resources.
- Although a resource may have start and end availability dates, it is not associated with a collection of multiple availability records.
- Relationship lags are not available.
- Assignment data cannot be changed after the assignment has been created, but Open Plan can delete and recreate the assignment.
- The Task Actual Duration field is read-only.
- Task baseline fields (Baseline Start and Baseline Finish) are read-only.
- Task, resource, and project custom fields may be created within the Project Server environment. Open Plan imports and exports task and resource custom fields, but not project custom fields. User fields that are specific to MSP (for example, TEXT1, NUMBER1, and so on) are not available.

## MSP Import/Export Modes

The export module was previously limited to a single create/overwrite mode when exporting data from Open Plan to MSP. You are now able to update status in existing MSP projects. Additionally, you may limit the activities exported to MSP by setting a filter.

For both the import and export modules, Open Plan processes resource assignments differently by taking advantage of the MSP time-scaled objects collection. When exporting, this allows the simulation of offsets and periods on multiple resource assignments in OP for the same activity/resource description combination by setting different values in the MSP time-scaled buckets for that activity/resource. When importing, conversely, multiple assignments can be created in OP from a single assignment in MSP based on differences between the time buckets.

With importing, you can now create or update the PMB baseline for the OP project if a baseline (the master baseline, not baselines 1 through 10) has been established in MSP for the imported project. Baselines are not exported back to MSP.

Finally, in order to preserve the export functionality that customer who are used to the MSPRIF utility expect, MSPRIF Compatible export option has been added, which is intended to give backwards compatibility with OP3.3.2 and 3.4.1 for activity progress and resource assignments.

### MSP Export: Expected Behavior in Each Export Mode

| Exported Collection | Create/Replace Mode | Status Update Mode | MSPRIF Compatibility | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Calendars (if an export filter is specified, the result is similar to using the _EXPORT_ONLY_CALS_IN_USE preference, except that the calendars must be in use and associated with activities included by the filter). | All calendars and calendar exceptionsÂ¹ exported | New calendars and their calendar exceptionsÂ¹ exported (we do not update/delete exceptions on an existing calendar in MSP). | N/A | |
| Resources (if an export filter is specified, the result is similar to using the _EXPORT_ONLY_RES_IN_USE preference, except that the resources must be in use and associated with activities included by the filter). | All resources and availabilities on resources exported (calendars assigned to availabilities will also be exported) | New resources, their availabilities, and availability calendars are added; user-mapped fields are exported. | N/A | |
| Tasks (may be filtered by the export filter) | All tasks and their progress information are exported. | New tasks are exported in their entirety (may be filter). | With MSPRIF turned on, task progress is | |

# Exported Collection Create/Replace Mode vs Status Update Mode

| Exported Collection | Create/Replace Mode | Status Update Mode | MSPRIF Compatibility Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| User-mapped fields on all existing activities are exported (may be filter). | The following fields in MSP may be updated without mappings as a part of the progress update: duration, actual dates, progress values as noted in the MSPRIF column, constraint type, and constraint date. | See comments in "MSPRIF Compatibility Notes" mode column for information on updating progress in MSP. exported as it was in 3.4.1. If the option is NOT enabled, remaining duration, percent complete, and complete progress types are exported |
| Relationships (will be included if no export filter or if associated activities have been included by the export filter) | All relationships for included activities are added (both predecessor and successor must be included by the export filter, if specified). | Relationships are added in cases where a newly added activity is either a predecessor or successor and the other end of the relationship is an included activity. Existing relationships are not updated. | N/A |
| Assignments (will be included if no export filter or if associated activities have been included by the export filter) | Assignments for all included tasks are exported. If resource progress is enabled, either remaining or % complete will be exported to the MSP assignment. See comments in "MSPRIF Compatibility Notes" mode column for information on | Assignments for an included activity will be created or replaced in MSP with current data. | With MSPRIF turned on, resource assignments are exported as they were in 3.4.1. This also means that resource progress is not exported. If the option is NOT enabled, resource progress may be exported and we write detailed time phased data for assignments |

*1 "Exceptions" refers to special days, such as holidays or normal non-working days (e.g., Saturday and Sunday) that become a working day.*

## Exporting OP Assignments to Microsoft Project

### Exporting Levels, Offsets, and Periods

Let's begin by looking at several assignments for an activity in OP.

There are four resource categories in Open Plan:
- Labor
- Material
- Other direct costs
- Subcontract

There are three resource categories in MSP:
- Work
- Material
- Cost

In our example above, Jim Armstrong represents a labor resource in OP (corresponding to a work resource in MSP). MY COSTS is an other direct costs resource (corresponding to a cost resource in MSP). TESTING EQUIPMENT is a material resource in both OP and MSP. A subcontract resource (not shown in the example) in OP is treated as a material resource in MSP.

| OP Resource Type | MSP Resource Type |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Labor | Work |
| Material | Material |
| ODC (other direct cost) | Cost |
| Subcontract | Material |

In OP, the combination of resource ID + Skill ID + Cost Class defines a resource assignment of a certain type. For the purpose of creating or updating a resource assignment within MSP, we only use the resource ID or Skill ID to define a resource of a certain type. The Skill ID will be ignored, unless the Resource ID field is blank. The Cost Class field is ignored, so the first two assignments above for Jim Armstrong represent a single assignment in MSP. Since OP does not export pool (parent) resources to MSP, if the resource ID listed is a pool (not the case in this example), we will try to resolve the pool to a child resource. We may be able to do this by examining usage records for the activity.

Therefore, in this example, we will create or replace three resource assignments for activity 1 since we have three different assignment combinations. In order to translate the offsets and periods shown into properly allocated time-scaled buckets in MSP, we must deselect the MSPRIF Compatibility option in the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page.

After exporting, open the project within MSP. From the standard Gantt chart (go to the View tab if the Task Usage option is not available on the File tab), choose to display task usage:

The Task Usage grid will appear to the right of the spreadsheet with Work displayed under the Details column. The following will now be displayed in MSP:

Looking first at Jim Armstrong in OP, note that for one of Jim's assignments (offset = 0, period = 1d), the offset/period is reflected in the first day of the period shown in MSP, with the level per day of 4 (as in OP). Since the other assignment for Jim has an offset of 2 days, the second day of the period is empty, and the third period contains the level of 3:

One other thing to note with the export of resource assignments: when exporting with the MSPRIF Compatibility option enabled, the assignments units field in MSP is set to represent the level per day in OP. When this option is disabled, and time-scaling (as above) is also being done, MSP is allowed to set the units field based on the work or cost values that was furnished. Typically for labor (work) resources, this will amount to the units value being set to 1. This is not a problem since the work and cost values are the more important values for MSP. The units field also does not reflect levels accurately for offsets and periods in OP.

### Exporting Resource Assignment Progress

As mentioned earlier, the Resource Progress option in the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page is enabled only if the MSPRIF Compatibility option is disabled, AND you choose to export resources. You may choose either to export remaining duration or resource physical percent complete to MSP. In order to set either of these values within the OP Activity Progress dialog, the Progress Based on Activity Progress option in the Resource Details dialog box must be deselected to modify values in the quantity rows. The Actual Cost Based on Progressed Quantity option must be deselected to modify values in the cost rows.

In the Activity Progress dialog box in OP, each resource group will appear on its own row (assignments for the same group will be summarized).

With the six assignments shown earlier in the example, we will see the following in the Activity Progress dialog box:

> **Note:** MSP will apply the escalated cost as opposed to the standard cost (if escalated costs exist for the resource), we need to make sure we are comparing the cost values shown in MSP to the OP Resource Escalated Cost.

The values in the Phy. % and Remaining columns can be changed to apply progress to the resources. If we change the values as follows:

The changes made can be seen in the Resource Assignment spreadsheet (RESSPDVW):

If the project is exported to MSP and the Resource Progress option is set to Use Assgn. Remaining, the following will be seen in MSP if you choose to display Task Usage and add Actual Work to the Details column. While there is no direct display of remaining duration, you can calculate this by subtracting work â actual work (7 days â 3 days = 4 days)

You can see remaining work by double-clicking the Task Usage row for Jim Armstrong to invoke the Assignment Information dialog box in MSP:

> **Note:** Change in remaining duration has been applied to one of the two assignments, while the change in physical % complete has been applied to both.

MSP calculates % Work Complete based on the remaining work that we set when exporting.

If you rerun the export, this time setting the Resource Progress option to Assgn. PCC, % Work Complete reflects the value we exported from OP, and remaining work is calculated.

If multiple assignments exist in OP for the same activity/resource combination, the PPC will be calculated for each of the multiple assignments by multiplying the PPC for the assignment by the fraction of the total level (across the multiple assignments) that the single assignment represents.

For example:

| Assign. # | Total Level | PPC | Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | 15 | 20% | .2 * (15/55) = 5.45% |
| 2 | 10 | 15% | .15 * (10/55) = 2.73% |
| 3 | 30 | 25% | .25 * (30/55) = 13.64% |
| Total | 55 | 21.82% | |

MSP does not allow you to set remaining cost on cost resources. Instead, we set the % work complete (calculated from remaining cost). Progress on cost resources is NOT time-scaled because of this.

## Additional Notes on Export Functionality

### Duration Units and Costs while Exporting

The Default Units chosen for an OP project (in the Project Properties dialog box on the Preferences tab) may affect resource costs. As far as MSP export is concerned, the units that are of interest to us are days or hours (any other time unit is exported as days for purposes of the export). On the Options page of the MSP Export Wizard in the Export Resources group, we may set the option "OP levels represent":

If Default Units is chosen here, MSP Export will use the value chosen in the Project Properties dialog box on the Preferences tab for the Default Duration Unit (days or hours). Otherwise, it will use the user selected value (days or hours). The option chosen in the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page may override the setting in Project Properties. OP does not specify a time unit on its resources, simply a unit. The unit is interpreted based on the Project Properties default units setting. MSP, however, always specifies a time unit for resource costs. Depending on the setting in the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page, the cost for resource Jim Armstrong, for example, may be specified as $50.00/day or $50.00/hour in MSP. So, if Jim Armstrong has a level of 5/day, the cost per day of that resource per day will be $50.00 * 5 units/day ($250.00) if the levels represent days, and $50.00 * 8 hours/day * 5 units/day ($2000.00) if the levels represent hours.

For best compatibility, the resource unit chosen in OP should represent the same time unit for all resources (if possible), and the default units (in OP) should reflect the chosen unit. If the MSP option is then set to Default Units, then everything should line up.

### Using Filters while Exporting

A filter in OP may be applied in various ways. In an outlined view, such as the bar chart, if a child activity is included in a filter, its parent(s) will normally be included as well (this is referred to as filtering from the "bottom up"). The export filter is implemented for MSP Export to include only those activities exactly matching the filter (parents are excluded unless they also match the filter).

If an export filter is defined, this affects not only the activities that are exported, but also limits the calendars, resource definitions, relationships, and assignments that are exported. For records from any of these ancillary or child collections to be exported to MSP, it is necessary that they be associated with activities included by the filter. For example, if the filter limits the activity collection in OP to a single activity, only assignments for that single activity will be created or updated in MSP. In turn, only resource definitions needed for those assignments will be exported.

### MSPRIF Compatibility while Exporting

The MSPRIF Compatibility option (available on the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page) is designed to suppress new functionality in MSP export that might undermine the main purpose of the old MSPRIF Visual Basic application, now incorporated into the OP product, which is to produce a schedule in MSP whose dates reflect, as closely as possible the schedule in OP. If the MSPRIF Compatibility option is enabled, assignments will be exported to MSP in the same fashion as they are currently in the 3.4.1 and 3.3.2 versions of OP

- multiple assignments for the same activity/resource combination will be combined, but the time-scaled collection on the MSP assignment will NOT be used to simulate offsets and periods in OP;

- resource progress will NOT be applied since it could conceivably cause task dates and durations to change (with the option enabled, the Resource Progress option in the Microsoft Project Export â Options Page is disabled). In addition, with the option enabled, MSP export will look at the computed status (COMPSTAT) field on the OP activity table to determine whether an activity is planned, started, or complete. COMPSTAT is accurate only if time analysis is performed, and we cannot assume that Time Analysis has been performed prior to export the data. If the MSPRIF option is not enabled, we will ignore the COMPSTAT field when exporting progress and instead use the values in the PROGTYPE and PROGVALUE fields on the activity table.

### Additional Export Notes When Updating Existing MSP Files

- The update mode assumes that the Open Plan project being exported to MSP contains MSP unique ID values on the activity table (OPP_ACT), and if resources are also being exported, the MSPUNIQUEID field should also be populated on the resource table (OPP_RES). This will only be true if the OPP project being exported was previously imported from MSP. These values are used to connect OP records to the corresponding MSP records.

- If a record has been added in OP, it will have an MSPUNIQUEID value of 0, indicating that the task (or resource) needs to be created in MSP.

- If a previously imported MSP task record has been deleted in MSP, the activity in OP will have an MSPUNIQUEID value > 0 in OP, but the record will not be able to be matched in MSP (the unique ID for the deleted record is "retired" by MSP). We do not delete the OP activity but we do change the unique ID stored in OP back to 0. If a subsequent export is performed, OP will recreate the activity in MSP as it will appear to be new.

- If a record is deleted in OP, we make no attempt, at this time, to delete the record in MSP as well.

## Integration with Primavera P6

You can use Open Plan's integration interface to import Oracle Primavera P6 projects (including steps) from an .XER file or P6 web. The import facility provides a seamless integration with Primavera's current standard data formats.

You can import P6 XER files or you can import multiple projects from P6 Web as long as they are all from the same P6 web site and database. When you import, you can create a new Open Plan project, or update an existing Open Plan project (if it was originally imported from P6) and share resources, codes, and calendars.

Display the first page of the Oracle Primavera P6 Import Wizard by clicking Oracle Primavera Â» P6 Import on the Integration tab Import menu group.

### Exporting Open Plan Activity Status to Oracle Primavera P6

You can export from an Open Plan project (including steps) to an Oracle Primavera P6 XER file or P6 Web.

- **Web export:** A P6 web export only exports activity status/resource assignment status. The project that you are exporting must have previously been imported into Open Plan from P6.

- **XER export:** An XER export exports the entire Open Plan project.

> **Attention:** For information about best practices for importing/exporting data to/from P6, see the Open Plan online help topic titled: Best Practices for Importing/Exporting Data To/From P6 (Importing and Exporting Project Data Â» Oracle Primavera Integration Â» Oracle Primavera P6).

Display the first page of the Oracle Primavera P6 Export Wizard by clicking Oracle Primavera on the Integration tab Export menu group.

### View Exported Data

If you want to review the data that was exported to Oracle Primavera P6, add `_KEEP_P6_OUTPUT_FILES` with a value of 1 to the System Preferences dialog box ( Â» Preferences Â» Application Â» Advanced tab). Open Plan creates .csv integration files and saves them to the Open Plan working folder, for example, Documents Â» Deltek Â» Open Plan Professional 8.5. Each file has a unique name that includes the Primavera P6 project name and a time stamp.

If the setting is enabled, the generated .csv files will remain in the folder until you delete them (disabling the setting will not delete accumulated files). You may want to periodically delete them to keep the folder size from becoming too large.

### Limiting Calendar and Resource Export

You can add these options to the System Preferences dialog box ( Â» Preferences Â» Application Â» Advanced tab) and specify whether you want Open Plan to export all of the calendars and resources in the calendar and resource file, or only those being referenced by the data.

**_EXPORT_ONLY_P6_CALS_IN_USE**

- 0 = Open Plan exports all of the calendars in the calendar file assigned to the project, whether or not they are being used by an activity. This is the default.

- 1 = Open Plan exports only those calendars that are being referenced by the data being exported. Open Plan follows these rules:
  - If a child calendar is exported, the parents in the hierarchy are also included in the export.
  - Calendars are included for all activities being exported.
  - The projects default calendar is always exported if it is not blank.
  - The projects default relationship calendar is always exported if it is not blank.
  - Calendars are included for all selected baselines on the open project.
  - A relationship calendar where both ends of the relationship are associated with activities being exported will be exported as long as it is not blank and is not <Calendar of Successor>.
  - If resources are being exported, calendars linked to availability records linked to included resources are also exported.

**_EXPORT_ONLY_P6_RES_IN_USE**

- 0 = Open Plan exports all of the resources in the resource file assigned to the project, whether or not they are being used by an activity. This is the default.

- 1 = Open Plan exports only those resources that are being referenced by the data being exported. Open Plan follows these rules:
  - If a child resource is exported, the parents in the hierarchy are also included in the export.
  - Export resources assigned to activities being exported.

> **Attention:** For more information about integrating with Primavera P6, see Importing and Exporting Project Data Â» Oracle Primavera Integration in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

- If a resource assignment, resource usage record, or baseline usage record is associated with an activity that is being exported, Open Plan exports all resources referenced in the following fields: RES_ID, RES_SKL_ID, and ALT_RES_ID.

- If a cost record is associate with an included activity, Open Plan exports resources referenced in the RES_ID and RES_SKL_ID fields.

### Updating Existing Data When You Import Data From an XER File Into P6

By default, when you import data from an XER file into P6 and update an existing project, it keeps the existing values for the following fields:

- Resource Codes
- Resource Code Values
- Rates
- Resources
- Short Names
- Calendars

That means that if you have made changes to any of the above fields in Open Plan before exporting to the file you are importing into P6, the data will not be updated in the existing project.

To update the above fields:

1. In the P6 Import wizard, when you get to the Update Project Options page, click Modify.
2. Click in the Actions column for any of the fields you want to update that have Keep Existing selected and change the setting to Update Existing.

### Using the P6 API to Assign the P6 WBS Hierarchy to a User-Specific Index

By default, the P6 WBS code is stored at code index #1 in Open Plan; however, you can change the WBS code index number using the Open Plan API.

The P6WBSIndex element specifies the code index in a project where the P6 WBS structure is initially stored (for import) or retrieved (for export). The range of valid values for the index is 1 through 90 with the default value being 1.

When the code assignment is made during a new import, the prompt for the code file is set to P6WBS. Once the P6WBS prompt exists on the project, its index position is used for future imports and exports instead of the P6WBSIndex value. If needed, you can use the Open Plan API to assign the P6WBS code prompt to any code index you want. Make sure that you use that prompt only once within any given project. If Open Plan finds this prompt either within an Open Plan project being updated, or a project being created from a project template, it will use the corresponding code index to locate existing WBS elements or store new WBS elements.

## Integration with Primavera Project Planner (P3)

The Open Plan P3 import utility (Integration Â» Oracle Primavera Â» P3 Import) imports Primavera Project PlannerÂ® projects into Open Plan.

### Importing P3 Files

Display the Oracle Primavera P3 Import utility by clicking Oracle Primavera Â» P3 Import on the Integration tab Import menu group.

### P3 Data Storage

Primavera stores the data for each P3 project in a series of approximately 22 BtrieveÂ® files, each starting with the name of the project and having the extension .p3. The number of files in a P3 project can vary, depending upon the features used. One file that must be present in all P3 projects is named *DIR.P3 where the * represents a 4-character project name.

The Import P3 File utility reads the Btrieve files and converts them into a comma-delimited ASCII file that is imported into Open Plan. The files can be accessed directly from the directory on which the working version of the project is stored or from a backup created by Primavera.

> **Note:** When creating a backup in Primavera P3 of a file to import into Open Plan, it is important not to use the compressed option.

The conversion is controlled by the contents of a data definition file, defined in a later section. This data definition file and the script that controls the subsequent import into Open Plan provide some flexibility in what data to transfer and how.

### P3 Data Definition File

The P3 Import utility uses a file called P3toOP.Dat to define field mapping from P3 projects to Open Plan projects.

By default, Open Plan looks for the P3toOP.dat file on the startup directory, but this can be changed using command line options.

> **Attention:** For more information, see P3 Data Definition File.

### Command P3 Line Options

When adding P3 Import commands to the Open Plan Tools menu, refer to this list of command line options. The options that you can add to the command line include the following:

> **Attention:** For more information on running the import utilities from the Integration tab, see Importing and Exporting Project Data in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

| Option | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| /a | Followed by the name of the import script, automates the import to Open Plan. It is recommended that this be done only when running from the Tools menu. If specified, the /a option sets certain project data that cannot be set through the ASCII import process itself. For example, the /a option sets the multiple ends processing option to true or false for the newly created Open Plan project, matching how the option was set in the P3 project. |
| /c | Suppresses the message box that states that the file has been successfully imported. |
| /d | Followed by the name of the data definition file, which otherwise defaults to *.dat on the starting directory. This option can be used not only to make the directory explicit, but also if you want to create more than one export, for example with or without ancillary files. |
| /n | Suppresses the file dialog for the destination file, unless the specified or default file name turns out to be invalid. It can be used alone, or it can be followed by the name of the default export file, so that it incorporates the functionality of /o. |
| /o | Followed by the name of the destination file name, which otherwise defaults to <project name>. Notice that with this option the output file name is only a default â the dialog box is still displayed â and can be fully qualified, allowing you to use this option to modify just the directory without specifying an actual file. For example, *.xfr /oc:\output\ sets the directory on the Destination File dialog box to c:\output. |
| /p | Followed by the name of the P3 file to be imported, this option suppresses the display of the dialog box in which the file must otherwise be specified. |
| /s | When combined with the /a option, the /s option automatically performs the Save As command on the imported project. If the /t option is also specified, the Save operation is executed only after time analysis has been performed. |
| /t | When combined with the /a option, the /t option automatically performs time analysis on the imported program. |
| /x | This option prevents the program from attempting to use the Open Plan working directory as a default in the import dialog boxes. This option is intended for use in situations where an ASCII file is required as output and Open Plan is not installed. |

> **Note:** To have output be recognized as a directory, it must be followed by a backslash on the command line.

### Import P3 File Utility Known Limitations

Not all data is transferred. The following list describes the known limitations using the Import P3 File utility:

- Primavera Finest Hour and ADM projects are not supported.

- There is limited support for Primavera micro-scheduled projects. Durations in these projects are correctly represented, as are the standard weekly shift patterns. Some other details, including the time component of any date fields, are not transferred.

- Complex resource assignments â offset and period or spread curves â are not transferred.

- In the TTL table, each set of codes has a name and description, stored in a special record with a code value starting with 8 asterisks. No attempt is made to process this record, except to provide a default code file name as described in Export of File Names.

- Because of a mismatch between the two systems, it is not always possible to convert all constraint dates. (Primavera allows one early constraint and one late constraint; Open Plan allows one start constraint and one finish constraint.)

- Primavera has a facility to automatically move a recurring holiday to the next working day, should it fall on a non-working day. Open Plan does not have this capability, so the imported calendar may need to be adjusted manually.

- Sometimes records in the ASCII file that is created contain blank values in positions where a blank is not valid. The instances that have been observed appear to represent data that has actually been deleted in P3. When these blank lines are encountered during the import, Open Plan issues a warning in the log and ignores the record.

- The Import P3 File utility does not read data created by versions of P3 that use Btrieve versions prior to 6.x. This includes P3 version 1.1, SureTrak version 1.5, and P3/Finest Hour for DOS 5.1. To import programs created with these versions, open them in P3 version 2.0 before importing them with the Import P3 File utility.

- Because the target project finish date in P3 is always a "Not Later Than" target, Open Plan always uses "NL" as the target type in the import. If the target has not been set in Primavera, this will create the odd but harmless situation in Open Plan of setting the target type even though the target date is not set.

### Data Definition File

The data definition file controls the transfer of data. In most cases, data must be referenced in this file in order to be included in the transfer.

> **Note:** When creating or modifying a data definition file, be careful to match data types correctly. Unexpected results can occur â spurious end-of-file or end-of-line characters, for example â if you try to interpret binary data as character data.

The p3toop.dat file supplied with the Import P3 File utility provides an example of content that can be included in a data definition file. The standard data structure information is included in Sample Data Definition File.

When reviewing the p3toop.dat file note the following:

- Lines starting with a single quote are comment lines.

- Lines starting with an asterisk introduce a Primavera table or file. (The asterisk is meant to represent a wild card.) So, allowable files are *DIR.P3, *ACT.P3, *REL.P3, *HOL.p3, etc. (but not *CAL.P3; this file is not a Btrieve file!). The tables are processed in the order specified.

- Some Primavera files are defined as required, while others are optional. Required Primavera files have the extension .P3; optional files have the extension .p3. For example, *DIR.P3 and *ACT.P3 are required files while *HOL.p3 and *TTL.p3 are optional files. The Import P3 File utility does not issue an alert if an optional file is missing from p3toop.dat, nor does it report the missing optional file as an error.

- Following the line introducing the table, there are a number of lines specifying fields to be output. Each line comprises four values separated by spaces as follows:

  - Field name (This is currently ignored, but in the supplied file we have tried to use the corresponding Open Plan field name, as a reminder.)
  
  - Field offset on the Btrieve record (This is available from the Primavera documentation, but subtract 1 because the offset is measured from 0. An offset of â1 also has a special meaning. See below.)
  
  - Field type (See below.)
  
  - Field length in bytes on the Btrieve record. (This information may seem somewhat redundant because in most cases the field length is known. While the value in the field length may be ignored, it must be present. The user-defined length is used only for the ACTID, CHAR, and WBS field types.)

- A negative offset indicates a constant value to be inserted into the output file. For example:
  ```
  LEV_TYPE -1 T 0
  ```
  will place a 'T' for total into the assignment records. (The final '0' is ignored but needs to be there to make up the four parameters.)

- Each record on the output file comprises the record type (derived from the table name and referenced in the P3imp.xfr file during the import process) and the specified fields in the order defined. The data is generated in the order specified on the data definition file. Therefore, it is important that tables are processed in a logical order. For example, the REL table cannot be processed before the ACT table, which defines the activities.

The recognized field types are:

- ACTID (See Note 1)
- ACTTYPE (Translates enumerated values to 'N', etc.)
- CALCCODE (See Note 2)
- CHAR (Character string.)
- CONSTRAINTFLAGS (See Note 3)
- CONSTRAINTDATES (See Note 3)
- CRITICALFLAG (Translates critical flag from blank/'C' to 0/1)
- DATE (4-byte integer, formatted for output as YYYYMMDD)
- DUR (See Note 4)
- DURATIONS (See Note 5)
- LONG (4-byte integer)
- MONEY (4-byte integer with two implied decimal places)
- PCT (4-byte integer with one implied decimal place)
- RELTYPE (Translates enumerated values to 'FS', etc.)
- RESCODE (See Note 6)
- RESVALUE (See Note 6)
- SHORT (2-byte integer)
- THRESHOLD (See Note 7)
- WBS (See Note 7)

#### Notes

1. The ACTID data type interprets the first two characters of the field to determine the subproject to which it belongs, if any, and creates a qualified activity name. Thus, if the suffix "FR" has been defined as referring to subproject "FRED," then activity "FR0100" will become "FRED.FR0100."

   > **Note:** Use the CHAR data type if you do not want the features of ACTID. Notice that you must be consistent for all tables that use activity IDs.

2. The CALCCODE data type interprets the "Duration Calculation Code" field in P3. This field can contain either the expected finish date or a flag that indicates that the activity is one of the following:
   - Zero total float
   - Zero free float
   - Hammock

   If the value is a date, it is transferred to the expected finish date; otherwise, it is used to set the activity type to ALAP (in the first two cases) or Hammock, overriding the value interpreted by ACTTYPE.

   > **Note:** In order for this feature to operate correctly, the p3toop.dat file must contain the CALCCODE definition before the ACTTYPE definition.

3. CONSTRAINTFLAGS and CONSTRAINTDATES work in combination and are necessary because there is not a one-to-one correspondence between the constraint data held in Primavera and that in Open Plan:

   - CONSTRAINTFLAGS actually processes two fields that have to be considered together and creates two output values that represent the start target type and the finish target type.
   
   - CONSTRAINTDATES also processes two fields, which have to be considered together and which can be interpreted correctly only if CONSTRAINTFLAGS has already been processed. (For example, CONSTRAINTFLAGS must precede CONSTRAINTDATES.) It creates four output fields: actual start, actual finish, target start, and target finish.

   > **Note:** This is necessary because Primavera uses one date field to hold actual start, early start target, or early finish target and one to hold actual finish, late start target, or late finish target.

4. Durations are stored as short integers (2 bytes) but the time unit is determined from the DIR table. P3 Import adds a letter (typically a "d" or "h") to indicate this.

5. The DURATIONS keyword enables the two P3 fields (a total of 4 bytes) that represent the original duration and the remaining duration to be processed as a pair to create progress information in Open Plan. Three fields are generated on the output file in the following order: the original duration, the progress type, and the progress value. These are determined as follows:

   - If remaining duration is equal to original duration, progress type is blank ("planned") and progress value is also blank.
   
   - If remaining duration is zero, progress type is "C" (complete), and progress value is blank.
   
   - Otherwise, progress type is "R" (remaining duration), and progress value contains the remaining duration.

6. RESCODE is used to turn generic resource codes (those ending in an asterisk) into resource pools. For example, if you have resources ENG* and ENG1, these will be turned into ENG and ENG.ENG1.

   > **Note:** Use the CHAR data type if you do not want the features of RESCODE. Notice that you must be consistent in using RESCODE for all tables that contain resource code fields.

7. RESVALUE is used for resource levels on the assignment records. The data is basically a long integer, but it may have two implied decimal places. This field type enables the program to interpret it correctly, depending upon a flag in the DIR file, that indicates the implied decimal places.

8. THRESHOLD is necessary because of a mismatch between the capabilities of Primavera and Open Plan with regard to the definition or resource availability. Primavera allows a "normal" and a "maximum" value to be specified independently for up to six different time intervals. Open Plan, on the other hand, allows only the normal value to be specified (but for an unlimited number of time intervals) while allowing a constant threshold to be added to this to get the maximum. The THRESHOLD data type, therefore, accesses two LONG fields representing one of the pairs of values (normally the first) and generates one field representing the difference between them. The use of this data type also affects the creation of the availability records, as described in the next section.

9. WBS takes the Primavera WBS field, stored as a 48-character string without punctuation and interprets it using data from the *DIR.P3 file to punctuate it with periods.

   > **Note:** Use the CHAR data type if you do not want to use punctuation.

### Special Processing

Some data ignores processing in the generic way described above. The following tables need special processing:

#### *DIR.P3

Regardless of whether this is explicitly mentioned in the data definition file, it is necessary to access this file. Among the information found in this table are:

- The subproject mapping (see ACTID data type above)
- The data necessary to split up the code field (see *ACT.P3 below)
- The data necessary to punctuate the WBS field (see WBS data type above)
- The standard weeks for the calendars
- The duration unit

Regardless of the existence of an explicit reference to this table, the utility will create an OPP record (see next section) and a SUB record for each subproject defined.

> **Note:** Although it is not possible to suppress the creation of SUB records, it is possible to modify the import script so as to ignore them.

The format of the SUB records is fixed as follows:

- Record type "SUB"
- Subproject ID
- Subproject Description
- "P" to indicate the subproject activity type

Notice that there are multiple records on this table, and the interpretation is not constant. Therefore, an explicit reference to this table in the data definition file will address only the single main record that defines the overall project data (record type 0 and project name blank).

#### *ACT.P3

After each activity record, a number of records are output to define the code assignments for that activity. They have a fixed format:

- Record type "COD"
- Activity ID
- Code number
- Code value

Primavera allows up to 24 subdivisions of the code field, which are assigned to codes 1 through 24 in Open Plan. If this feature is used in conjunction with the WBS field, the latter should be assigned to a code field, which is not to be used, for example code 25.

> **Note:** The data format produced for record type COD cannot be controlled by the user and is designed to match the standard import script, P3imp.xfr.

> **Note:** Although it is not possible to suppress this output, it is possible to modify the import script so as to ignore it. Also, if you prefer to keep the 64-character code in one piece, you can import it to a single Open Plan field.

#### *RLB.P3

After each RLB record, a number or records are output to define the availabilities and escalations. The first RLB record also triggers the output of an OPR record (see the Export of Filenames section).

The format for the availability is:

- Record type "AVL"
- Resource code
- Resource level
- Start date
- Finish date

> **Note:** The data format produced for record type AVL cannot be controlled by the user and is designed to match the standard import script, p3imp.xfr.

The data used for the level depends upon whether or not the THRESHOLD data type was used in the definition of the RLB table. If it was, then the "normal" value is used; otherwise, the "maximum" value is used. The first start date is derived from the project start, while the last finish date (if blank) is derived from the project finish date, or (as a last resort) 10 years beyond the start date.

The format for the escalations is:

- Record type "RSL"
- Resource code
- Price
- Start date

Notice that Open Plan stores the first price on the main RDS record, so there will be one less escalation record than there are prices defined in Primavera.

> **Note:** The data format produced for record type RSL cannot be controlled by the user and is designed to match the standard import script, P3imp.xfr.

#### *HOL.p3

The mere existence of the *HOL.p3 line triggers the output of all the calendar information, much of which is actually stored on the *DIR.P3. The format is fixed, as follows:

- Record type "CLD"
- Date specification (day of week, generic or specific date)
- Calendar number
- Start time
- Finish time
- Whether working or not

The existence of this section also triggers the output of an OPC record.

> **Note:** The data format produced for record type CLD cannot be controlled by the user and is designed to match the standard import script, P3imp.xfr.

> **Attention:** For more information about the OPC record, see Export of Filenames.

#### *WBS.p3

The first WBS record triggers the output of an OPB record.

> **Attention:** For more information about the OPB record, see Export of Filenames.

#### *TTL.p3

Primavera stores a code name and a description for each different set of codes. On the data file, this is stored as a special code value, comprising the 4-character code name followed by eight asterisks. This special record triggers the output of an OPR record in addition to creating a TTL record.

> **Attention:** For more information about the OPR record, see Export of Filenames.

#### Export of Filenames

Five special record types contain a suggested name for the project file and for all ancillary files. The record types and the way the name is formed are as follows:

- **Project (record type OPP):** the 4-character name of the Primavera project, plus the extension .opp.

- **Resource Pool (record type OPR):** the 4-character name of the Primavera project, plus the extension .opr.

- **Calendar (record type OPC):** the 4-character name of the Primavera project, plus the extension .opc.

- **WBS Code (record type OPB):** the 4-character name of the Primavera project, plus the characters "WBS" and the extension .opb.

- **Other Codes (record type OPB):** the 4-character name of the Primavera project, plus the 4-character code name and the extension .opb.

(The extensions are included for compatibility with Open Plan 2.x, but are ignored in Open Plan 3.0.)

There is an OPB record for each code file that is to be created in Open Plan, so it is also necessary to specify the code number. The regular codes are numbered as in Primavera, from 1 to 24, while the WBS code is numbered 25.

While the user cannot control the creation of any of the above records, it is of course possible to suppress the import of them by not referring to them in the import script.

### Import Script Considerations

An example of an import script (p3imp.xfr) is provided. Refer to the "Sample Import Script" section of this topic.

> **Attention:** For details on how scripts work, see Importing and Exporting Project Data in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

There are a few special considerations to be aware of:

- The UPDATE keyword needs to be used for the RLB table if the RESCODE data type is used. This is because the resource codes do not necessarily appear in the correct order. Therefore, the export creates all the pools first using just the code itself, and then follows this with a full record for the pools when they are encountered. This second entry for the same resource code needs to be processed as an update.

- The UPDATE keyword also needs to be used for the record types COD and WBS because the ACT record type creates activity records.

- The WBS data is put into code C25 because there can be up to 24 regular codes. If you want to put the WBS into a different code field, this can be done only within the import script. Just look for C25 in the standard script; it appears twice. (If you do this, you may also want to suppress the import of OPB records since the file name for the WBS is created as if for code 25.)

# Integration

## Custom Import/Export Options

In addition to importing/exporting Microsoft Project and Primavera projects, Open Plan also offers a more general capability based on user-defined import/export specifications. Each specification consists of a series of commands and parameters that allow Open Plan to import and export project, resource, code, and calendar information to a wide range of data formats.

Open Plan provides a number of standard import/export specifications that allow you, for example, to export a simple comma-delimited text file containing activity IDs and descriptions that can be read by many types of applications. It is also possible to create your own scripts for special-purpose operations.

### General Import

To import project information, select the Integration tab and click General in the Import menu group to display the following dialog box:

You can use this dialog box to select an import specification. When you click OK, Open Plan allows you to open a source data file and create an untitled project containing the imported information. If the project includes references to ancillary data files such as resource or code files, Open Plan creates untitled versions of these files as well.

If you have a project open when you issue the Import General command, Open Plan allows you to indicate if the imported data should be used to update the current project. Note, however, that whether or not the imported data overwrites existing records is determined by a parameter set in the import specification.

To import project data, complete the following steps:

1. On the Integration tab, click General in the Import menu group.
2. Select the specification for the operation.
   Select the Add data to open project <project name> option if you want Open Plan to update the current project with the imported data.
3. Click OK.
4. Select the source data file and click Open.
   Open Plan displays an untitled project for the imported project.
5. To save the project as an Open Plan project, click Â» Save or Save As.

> **Attention:** For a description of the scripts, see Custom Import/Export Scripts.

If the project includes references to ancillary data files, you must save the ancillary data files as well.

### General Export

To export project information, select the Integration tab and click General in the Export menu group to display the following dialog box:

To export project data, complete the following steps:

1. Open the project you want to export.
2. On the Integration tab, click General in the Export menu group.
3. Select the export specification for the operation.
4. Click OK.
5. Select a destination folder for the project and click Save.

> **Attention:** For a description of the scripts, see Custom Import/Export Scripts.

### Crosstable Export

To export crosstable data, click Crosstable Data from the Export group of the Integration tab. This opens the Crosstable Exports dialog box.

The export specifications listed on this dialog box include those that you have created as well as those that other users have created and opted to share. When you select an export specification and click Run, you are given the opportunity to save the export file in either .xml or .csv format. You may also click on View to see those export files that have been utilized in the past.

The buttons along the bottom of the dialog box allow you to create, copy, edit, and delete export specifications. When you create, copy, or edit an export specification, a tabbed dialog box allows you to select the elements to include in the export file. The default view is the General tab.

> **Note:** Elements that have a value of zero are exported as a blank value instead of a zero (0).

> **Attention:** For more information including field descriptions for each tab, see Importing and Exporting Project Data Â» Crosstable Exports in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

## Custom Import/Export Scripts

When you click General in the Import or Export menu group on the Integration tab, Open Plan displays a list of processing scripts that can be used to import or export project data. By default, all general import or export scripts are based on the contents of the Transfer.dat file, located in the local system folder.

Transfer.dat is a text file that can be edited using any text editor. It can contain both script definitions and pointers to separate include files. Each line of a script must start with a command word.

> **Warning:** All import/export command scripts are case-sensitive. If you enter these commands in lower or mixed case, you may receive error messages during the import or export procedure.

In cases where a local version of Transfer.dat is not present, for example, workstation installations, use a copy of Transfer.dat stored in the working folder of the Open Plan server. The contents of Transfer.dat is displayed in two dialog boxes:

The Import dialog box lists the following import scripts by default:

- **Activity Information** â This script creates activities in Open Plan with the following information:
  - ID
  - Description
  - Early Dates
  - Late Dates
  - Scheduled Dates
  - User Character Fields 1 and 2

- **Import Resource Actual Time and Cost** â This script imports actual time and cost data into the following fields of the Open Plan CST table:
  - ACT_ID (Activity ID)
  - RES_ID (Resource ID)
  - ACWP_QTY (Actual Quantity of Work Performed for the period)
  - ACWP_CST (Actual Cost of Work Performed for the period)
  - START_DATE (Period Start date)
  - END_DATE (Period Finish date)

  > **Note:** This script adds new records to the existing data. It does not update existing records.

- **Simple Activity Table Import** â This script imports a comma-delimited text file for use when importing data from the following ACT table fields:
  - OPP_ID (Activity ID)
  - DESCRIPTION (Activity Description)
  - ORIG_DUR (Original Duration)
  - ESDATE (Early Start date)
  - EFDATE (Early Finish date)
  - COMPSTAT (Computed Status)

  > **Note:** Selecting the Add data to open project <name> option on the Import dialog box allows Open Plan to add the data to the open project but does not overwrite the existing data.

The Export dialog box lists the following export scripts by default:

- **Baseline Export to Cobra (Activities)** â This script prepares a transaction file for exporting activity baseline information into Cobra.

- **Baseline Export to Cobra (Assignments)** â This script prepares a transaction file for exporting resource assignment baseline information into Cobra.

> **Note:** A sample application (RunXMLReports.vbs) that uses the XML Export scripts is added to the Add-Ins tab during the Open Plan installation.

### Basic Import and Export Scripts

The following example is designed to help you understand some of the basic import and export scripting features in Open Plan. Assume that your installation includes the following scripts:

- Exporting basic activity information using a comma-delimited text file
- Importing basic activity information using a comma-delimited text file

An example of the Transfer.dat contents might display as follows:

```
EXPORT csv Simple Activity Export to Excel
REM exports ID,Desc,Duration,ESDate,EFDate,Activity Cost
TABLE ACT
SORT ACT_ID
FIELD ACT_ID
FIELD DESCRIPTION
FIELD ORIG_DUR
FIELD ESDATE

IMPORT csv Simple Activity Import from Excel
REM imports ID, Description, and Duration
TABLE ACT
FIELD ACT_ID
FIELD DESCRIPTION
FIELD ORIG_DUR

EXPORT xml Example XML Activity Export 1
INCLUDE ACTDATA1.XFR
```

> **Note:** If used as delimiters in any field, certain symbols may cause problems when importing and exporting data. These symbols are quotation marks ("), commas (,), piping symbols (|), and semicolons (;).

Notice that two special commands define the start of a new import or export script. Each import script must begin with an IMPORT command that uses the following syntax:

```
IMPORT <extension> <name>
```

Everything from this command to the next IMPORT or EXPORT command (or to the end of file) will define the import script. The `<name>` appears in the Open Plan Import dialog box.

The IMPORT command must have a default extension associated with the ASCII source file, for example:

```
IMPORT csv Excel file
```

This extension can be a wild card character such as an asterisk (*), for example:

```
IMPORT * Excel
```

Each export script must begin with an EXPORT command using the following syntax:

```
EXPORT <extension> <name>
```

Everything from this command to the next IMPORT or EXPORT command (or to the end of file) will define the export script. The `<name>` appears in the Open Plan Export dialog box.

As in the case of the IMPORT command, EXPORT must have a default extension associated with the ASCII destination file, for example:

```
EXPORT XML Extended Markup Language (HTML)
```

This extension can be a wild card character such as an asterisk (*), for example:

```
EXPORT * XML
```

> **Note:** The following conventions are used in the following discussion of commands:
> - `<â¦>` Required parameters
> - `[â¦]` Optional parameters
> - `[â¦|â¦]` Choice of optional parameters

Following the IMPORT or EXPORT command, the two scripts for comma-delimited data include one or more instances of the following commands:

- TABLE
- RECORD_TYPE
- FIELD

The TABLE command indicates the current table for the script using the following syntax:

```
TABLE <optabletype>
```

The `<optabletype>` parameter can refer to either one of Open Plan's internal table types or to one of a small number of pseudo-tables defined in the section "Table Types" in this document. Everything from this command to the next TABLE, IMPORT, EXPORT, or end of file applies to this table.

The RECORD_TYPE command defines an identifier for the record type for this table, which is assumed to be the first item of each record. This command uses the following syntax:

```
RECORD_TYPE <recordtype>
```

The FIELD command designates the next field from the current table to be processed. This command uses the following syntax:

```
FIELD <opfieldname> [<width>|<header>][<format>]
```

The `<width>` and `<header>` settings are optional parameters. If the file is a fixed format, `<width>` indicates the width of the field. If the file is a delimited format (for example, with commas), and a preceding HEADER command has defined the header record type, the `<header>` parameter represents the identifier for this field.

The `<format>` parameter is an optional setting used when exporting numeric, date, or enumerated field data from Open Plan. You can specify different numeric formats using the following format conventions:

| Format | Result |
|--------|--------|
| ( | If the numeric value is negative, suppress the minus sign and print left parentheses instead. Ignore if the numeric value is positive. |
| ) | If the numeric value is negative, print right parentheses. Ignore if the numeric value is positive. |
| 9 | Print the digit from the source data, replacing leading zeros with spaces. |
| 0 | Print the digit from the source data, replacing leading spaces with zeros. |
| _(underscore) | Print the digit from the source data, suppressing leading spaces |
| . or, | Inserts a period (.) or a comma (,) |
| %X | Inserts the local currency symbol |
| %% | Inserts the percent sign (%) |
| %( | Inserts a left parenthesis |
| %) | Inserts a right parenthesis |

For example, assume a 10-character field named PPC contains the value 27.42. The following table demonstrates how to use the formats given in the preceding table and the result they would each return.

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| FIELD PPC 10 __________ | 27^^^^^^^ |
| FIELD PPC 10 0000000000 | 0000000027 |
| FIELD PPC 10 9999999999 | ^^^^^^^^27 |
| FIELD PPC 10 999,999.99 | ^^^^^27.42 |
| FIELD PPC 10 %X________ | $27^^^^^^^ |

You can use the `<format>` parameter to define the format of dates. For example, %M%D%Y produces dates such as 123103.

The `<format>` parameter can also be used to export the short form of an Open Plan enumerated field. For example, FIELD REL_TYPE S will export "FS" instead of "Finish To Start."

For export, the order of the FIELD commands defines the order of the fields to be output. This is also true for a fixed format import, or for an import without a header record. In the case of an import with a header record, only those fields defined on the header record are expected.

Notice that the previous example of a Transfer.dat file ends with an INCLUDE command. The INCLUDE command allows script files to be included by reference using the following syntax:

```
INCLUDE <filename>
```

INCLUDE files may be nested but must not include an IMPORT or an EXPORT command.

> **Note:** To see an example of an INCLUDE file, open one of the .xfr files provided with your installation of Open Plan.

### Additional Commands

In addition to the basic commands described above, custom import/export scripts can include any of the following commands:

- **ADD_MISSING_KEYS** â This Import General feature supports the keyword ADD_MISSING_KEYS. This keyword allows Open Plan to automatically create records for data that is missing from an import file. For example, assume that the import file has resources assigned to its activities but that the resource file assigned to the project contains no data. In this case, Open Plan can automatically create the referenced records in the resource file.

- **DATE_FORMAT** â Defines the format dates using the following syntax:
  ```
  DATE_FORMAT <format>
  ```

  The `<format>` parameter uses the date formats available in Open Plan. For example, %M%D%Y produces dates such as 123103.

  > **Attention:** For a description of date format strings in Open Plan, see Views and Reports Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Date Formats Dialog Box in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

  The DATE_FORMAT command ignores all values occurring after a space. To include a space in a date, put the `<format>` syntax within quotation marks. For example:

  | Command | Result |
  |---------|--------|
  | DATE_FORMAT %M/%D/%C_%H:%T | 06/02/2003_08:00 |
  | DATE_FORMAT %M/%D/%C %H:%T | 06/02/2003 |
  | DATE_FORMAT "%M/%D/%C %H:%T" | 06/02/2003 08:00 |

  This command applies to the current table and all tables until the next occurrence of DATE_FORMAT.

  Be aware that Open Plan requires two-digit month, day, and time formats when importing information from a comma-delimited file. For example, Open Plan will not import 2/5/04. It will, however, correctly interpret 02/05/04. Open Plan correctly interprets year information in either two-digit or four-digit formats.

  > **Note:** If you are creating or editing your import data in Excel, create a custom mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm format. Then apply this format to all date columns before saving the import file.

- **DELIMITED** â Specifies a character to be used as a delimiter using the following syntax:
  ```
  DELIMITED <character>
  ```

  The `<character>` parameter can be any character. In addition, two special characters can also be used:
  - `\t` uses a tab as the delimiter
  - `\0` uses the binary zero as a delimiter

  > **Note:** The default delimiter for import and export scripts is the comma. This default will be used when the DELIMITED command is not included or when it is included without specifying a character.

- **DURATION_FORMAT** â Defines the format of duration data being exported with the following syntax:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT <durunit> [<durstring>]
  ```

  The `<durunit>` parameter indicates if Open Plan should round the duration information to one of the following duration units:
  - m â months
  - w â weeks
  - d â days
  - h â hours
  - t â minutes

  For example, the statement:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT h
  ```
  results in all exported durations being rounded to the nearest hour.

  The optional `<durstring>` parameter allows you to substitute single-character abbreviations for the five duration units supported by Open Plan: months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. You must enter all five characters for this parameter. Thus, the statement:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT thdwm
  ```

  > **Note:** The primary purpose of the parameter thdwm is to support foreign language duration formats.

  It allows you to export durations rounded to the nearest hour using the French abbreviations for weeks and days.

  If you want to change the duration units, but do not want Open Plan to round the duration values, set the `<durunit>` parameter to an asterisk as in the following example:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT *thdwm
  ```

  It is also possible to set the `<durunit>` parameter to an exclamation point (!), which results in Open Plan exporting duration values as zeros rather than blanks. For example, the following statement:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT !
  ```
  results in the exportation of zero duration values using the default duration abbreviations. By contrast, the statement:
  ```
  DURATION_FORMAT !thdwm
  ```
  results in the exportation of zero duration values using the French duration abbreviations.

  This command applies to the current table and all tables until the next occurrence of DURATION_FORMAT.

- **FIELD_SPECIAL** â Transfers information not stored in a specific field using the following syntax:
  ```
  FIELD_SPECIAL <specialfieldname>
  ```

  The `<specialfieldname>` can be one of a set of special fields. This set currently includes:

  For any table:
  - $ROW_NUMBER$ (applies to exports only)
  - $PROJECT_NAME$

  For the activity table only:
  - $MPX_PREDS$
  - $MPX_PREDS_REPLACES$
  - $MPX_PRED_ROWS$
  - $MPX_TARGET_DATE$
  - $MPX_TARGET_TYPE$
  - $MPX_FIXED$
  - $BAAN_CODE_NUMBER$
  - $BAAN_CODE_VALUE$
  - $BAAN_CODE_DESC$

  For code tables only:
  - $CODE_NUMBER$
  - $BAAN_HIERARCHY_PARENT$
  - $BAAN_CODE_NUMBER$
  - $BAAN_CODE_NAME$
  - $BAAN_CODE_VALUE$
  - $BAAN_CODE_DESC$

  For the resource description table only:
  - $BAAN_HIERARCHY_PARENT$
  - $MPX_RES_UNIQUEID$
  - $MPX_RES_LEVEL$
  - $MPX_CAL$

  Special fields are also used to export constant values to an external application.

  Special fields are recognized by being at least two characters long and by the dollar sign ($) sign at the start and finish of the name. Anything else is treated as a literal constant. If you want to output a constant starting with a dollar sign use two dollar signs. Thus, both "$$" and "$" will print as a "$."

- **FILTER** â Applies a filter to the export data using the following syntax:
  ```
  FILTER [<filtername>] [<filterdefinition>]
  ```

  The filter definition should contain no spaces.

  The Export General feature supports the keyword filter. This keyword can be used to filter Open Plan data when creating an export file to be used when importing the project data into another application.

- **FIXED** â Defines the file as fixed-format using one of the following syntaxes:
  ```
  FIXED <fieldwidth>
  ```
  or
  ```
  FIXED <margin> <fieldwidth>
  ```

  If only one parameter is present, `<fieldwidth>` represents the number of characters needed to represent the data record type for each record. If both the `<margin>` and the `<fieldwidth>` parameters are present, the first parameter indicates how many characters to ignore before identifying the data record type.

  The FIXED command must precede the first TABLE command. In the absence of the FIXED command, Open Plan assumes the file to be comma-delimited.

- **HEADER** â Defines the record type of the header record, using the following syntax:
  ```
  HEADER <headerrecordtype>
  ```

  Header records indicate the fields to be imported or exported and their order, using identifiers that match the `<header>` parameter of the FIELD command.

- **LINK** â Links the current table to a previously defined table using the following syntax:
  ```
  LINK [<fieldname>]
  ```

  Typically, links are based upon the optional `<fieldname>` parameter. For example, the following statement in the definition of an assignment table:
  ```
  LINK ID
  ```
  will link the assignment table to the most recently defined activity table. Linking means that the assignment records appear directly after the activity record to which they apply.

  A special form of LINK without a field name will link to the most recently defined table of the same type, on a record-by-record basis. This allows more than one record type to be generated from a single record in the table.

  A table may be linked to a linked table, creating a chain of any desired length.

- **LITERAL_END** â Terminates literal data introduced by the LITERAL_HEADER or LITERAL_FOOTER commands using the following syntax:
  ```
  LITERAL_END
  ```

- **LITERAL_FOOTER** â Introduces a set of lines to be transferred at the end of the output for the current table using the following syntax:
  ```
  LITERAL_FOOTER
  ```

  The effect of this command is terminated by a LITERAL_END command.

- **LITERAL_HEADER** â Introduces a set of lines to be transferred at the beginning of the output for the current table using the following syntax:
  ```
  LITERAL_HEADER
  ```

  The effect of this command is terminated by a LITERAL_END command.

  > **Note:** The three LITERAL commands apply only to the exporting of data. Data between the LITERAL_HEADER command and the LITERAL_END command is transferred to the export file at the start of the data for the table. Data between the LITERAL_FOOTER command and the LITERAL_END command is transferred to the export file at the end of the data for the table.

- **MPX_CALENDAR_DEFINITION** â Processes calendar definitions in the format required by .mpx record type 20 using the following syntax:
  ```
  MPX_CALENDAR_DEFINITION
  ```

  This command is used only in conjunction with the CLH table type.

  > **Note:** For information about the CLH table type, see Table Types.

- **MPX_CALENDAR_HOURS** â Processes the definition of standard working hours in the format required by .mpx record type 25 using the following syntax:
  ```
  MPX_CALENDAR_HOURS
  ```

  This command is used only in conjunction with the CLH table type.

  > **Attention:** For information about the CLH table type, see Table Types.

- **MPX_CALENDAR_EXCEPTIONS** â Processes calendar exceptions (for example, holidays) in the format required by .mpx record type 26 using the following syntax:
  ```
  MPX_CALENDAR_EXCEPTIONS
  ```

  This command is used only in conjunction with the CLH table type.

  > **Attention:** For information about the CLH table type, see Table Types.

- **REM** â Allows you to add comment lines to a script using the following syntax:
  ```
  REM <comment>
  ```

  When executing a script, Open Plan ignores all lines starting with REM. REM cannot be used in any position other than the start of a line.

- **SKIP** â Defines the number of items to be skipped over before the next defined field using the following syntax:
  ```
  SKIP <numberoffields>|<numberofcharacters>
  ```

  If the table is delimited, `<numberoffields>` defines the number of fields to skip over. If the table is fixed-format, `<numberofcharacters>` defines the number of characters to skip over.

  This command is typically used to skip over unnecessary fields during an import operation.

- **SORT** â Allows you to apply a sort to the export data using a sort name or the following syntax:
  ```
  [-]<sort_field1>[,[-]<sort_field2>[,â¦
  ```

  where:
  - Square brackets indicate that the contents are optional
  - Each of the `<sort_fieldx>` values is either the name of an existing field on the appropriate table or the definition of a calculated field for that table
  - Negative signs indicate a descending rather than an ascending sort

  The sort definition should contain no spaces. For example, the following expression:
  ```
  SORT C1.codedesc,(ssdate-esdate)
  ```
  would sort descending on the difference between the scheduled start date and the early start date within the code 1 description. The parentheses in this example are included to make the expression easier to read. In actual usage they are optional.

  The Export General feature supports the keyword sort. This keyword can be used to sort Open Plan data when creating an export file that will be used to import project data into another application.

- **UPDATE** â Specifies that any existing records matching the incoming ones should be updated using the following syntax:
  ```
  UPDATE
  ```

  This command applies to import scripts only. Incoming data that matches existing records are automatically updated. If the data does not match any existing records, the new record is added.

  This command should be applied to each table that needs to be updated.

- **UPDATE_ONLY** â Specifies that the incoming data should be used only to update existing records with the same key values using the following syntax:
  ```
  UPDATE_ONLY
  ```

  This command applies to import scripts only. Incoming data that does not match an existing record is ignored.

  This command should be applied to each table that needs to be updated.

  > **Attention:** When tables are linked as a parent-child (for example, activities and assignments), if the parent is in UPDATE or UPDATE_ONLY mode and the child is not, all existing children are deleted before adding the new child records. When the LINK command is used to link two instances of the same table, the second and subsequent instances are automatically set into UPDATE_ONLY mode. Notice that the UPDATE command must specify all fields necessary (usually the key fields) to allow the creation of a record.

- **UPDATE_REMAINING** â Specifies that Remaining Quantity on activity Resource Assignments should be updated when Actual Quantities are imported for the Activity Resources and the resource is configured for manual progress by disabling the Progress Based On Activity Progress option on the resource.
  ```
  UPDATE_REMAINING
  ```

  This command is only supported on the CST table type and applies to import scripts only.

### Table Types

A table type is represented by a 3-character table identifier, which corresponds to the extensions used by projects stored in the actual database. Supported table types include tables that can be associated directly or indirectly with a project, plus a number of "pseudo-tables." These pseudo-tables do not display in Open Plan but are recognized for the purpose of importing and exporting.

Recognized table types include:

| Table Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ACT | Activity details |
| REL | Activity relationships |
| ANN | Baseline activities (for baseline 1, use A01) |
| UNN | Baseline resource usage (for baseline 1, use U01) |
| ASG | Resource assignments |
| CST | Resource actuals |
| USE | Resource usage |
| RSK | Risk key activities |
| RES | Resource definitions |
| AVL | Resource availabilities |
| RSL | Resource cost escalation (ESC is recognized as a pseudonym for this table type.) |
| CLH | Calendar header (CAL is recognized as a pseudonym for this table type.) |
| CLR | Calendar detail |
| SCA | Code structure association (CDH is recognized as a pseudonym for this table type.) |
| CNN | Refers to any number of attached code tables. |
| <nn> | Numeric that can be used to define a specific code table. |
| PRJ | Project directory details |

The order of TABLE commands in an export script defines the order in which the data is exported. In import scripts, the order of TABLE commands has no significance, except as already described for linked tables.

Tables can be defined more than once in a script. For example, to specify two sets of data using two different record types from the activity table, use two TABLE commands.

Tables can also be linked (see the discussion of the LINK command) so that data is interleaved. For example, in the .mpx format it is necessary for the assignment records to immediately follow the activity record to which they apply.

Data from normal tables is accessed by the field name, and any field that exists on the table can be accessed. However, data from a pseudo-table is accessed by means of special pseudo-field-names defined for that table type only.

The preferred way of accessing the PRJ table is by using the real field names. However, for backward compatibility we support:

- PROJECT_NAME for DIR_ID
- PATH_NAME for DIR_ID
- CALENDAR_PATH_NAME for CLD_ID
- RESOURCE_PATH_NAME for RDS_ID
- DESCRIP for DESCRIPTION
- MANAGER for OPMANAGER
- COMPANY for OPCOMPANY
- CLIENT for OPCLIENT

The PROJ_NOFCODES field name has no direct representation on the project table but can now be accessed using the "special field."

```
$PRJ_NOFCODES$
```

In order to access this table you need to enter the following syntax:

```
FIELD_SPECIAL $PRJ_NOFCODES$
```

Not

```
FIELD PRJ-NOFCODES
```

Pseudo-fields currently defined for the CDH pseudo-tables are:

- CODE_NUMBER
- CODE_NAME for COD_ID
- PATH_NAME for COD_ID
- DESCRIP for DESCRIPTION

Code numbers are assigned based on the order in which they are encountered.

Notice that calendar data is normally accessed using the CLH table type, and this can be done (for a default calendar) even when there is no calendar attached to the project. Users who want to read and interpret the raw calendar data in a calendar table should use the CLR table type.

Notice also that the use of the CNN table name will import and export data to or from any number of code files but all with the same record type. It is necessary to use the special field $CODE_NUMBER$ (see the discussion on the FIELD_SPECIAL command) to distinguish different code files. Alternatively, one can select specific code files (using the <nn> table type) and relate each file to specific record types.

> **Note:** The CODE_NAME field allows a user to specify a name in place of a code number. A code name would typically be the unqualified name of a code file; although, this is not a requirement if the name matches the CNN and ACT records. You cannot, however, use both CODE_NUMBER and CODE_NAME to import code information.

> **Note:** Although a combination of fields may form a unique identifier for an incoming record, such a combination may not serve as the key field. You must include the key fields for a given table in the import script.

## Importing and Exporting using XML

The generic import/export utility now supports XML documents. Each row of a table represents an element while each field represents an attribute. The table itself can be considered as a collection of elements, which in XML terms is just another element.

> **Note:** The default working directory created by Open Plan is the USER folder within the Open Plan destination folder. The USER folder contains style sheets (*.xls) and gif files Open Plan uses when exporting XML documents. If you have changed your output directory, you will need to copy the *.xsl and *.gif files from the USER folder to that output directory.

### Keyword ATTRIBUTE

This keyword is synonymous with FIELD and is provided to support the normal XML nomenclature and to distinguish it from the ELEMENT keyword defined below.

### Keyword ELEMENT

This keyword is similar to the FIELD keyword (see below) except that it causes the field to be transferred as an XML element rather than as an attribute. For example, if the ELEMENT keyword had been used for the activity ID field instead of the FIELD keyword in the examples in this section, it would look like this:

```xml
<ACTIVITY <ID>1</ID>
DESCRIPTION="Environment Management System"
ESDATE="02Jan97" />
```

> **Note:** Regardless of the order of ELEMENT and FIELD definitions, the elements are always output first. For input, the elements are always expected first.

### Keyword HIERARCHICAL

The keyword HIERARCHICAL used within a table definition causes export to be nested using the hierarchical key of that table. (It is ignored if the table is not hierarchical and thus works only for activity, resource description, and code tables.) Any linked tables are also nested, as can be seen in the following example script:

```
EXPORT XML XML Export (With Style Sheet)
DATE_FORMAT %D%A%Y
LITERAL_HEADER
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
LITERAL_END
STYLESHEET op1.xsl

TABLE ACT
HIERARCHICAL
XML_TAG ACTIVITIES
XML_TAG ACTIVITY
FIELD ID ID
FIELD ACT_DESC DESCRIPTION
FIELD ESDATE ESDATE

TABLE REL
XML_TAG PREDECESSORS
XML_TAG PREDECESSOR
LINK SUCC_ID
FIELD PRED_ACT_UID PRED_ACT_UID

TABLE REL
XML_TAG SUCCESSORS
XML_TAG SUCCESSOR
LINK PRED_ACT_UID
FIELD SUCC_ID SUCC_ID
```

Notes:

1. "STYLESHEET op1.xsl" causes the following to be included in the output:
   ```xml
   <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\op1.xsl"?>
   ```

2. "HIERARCHICAL" causes child activities to be nested within their parents. This is not shown by further indentation, but by the logical structure indicated by the tags. Child `<ACTIVITY>` tags appear between the `<ACTIVITY>` tag of the parent and its end tag `<\ACTIVITY>`.

The following example shows the output produced by the previous script:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href=" C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\op1.xsl"?>
<ACTIVITIES>

<ACTIVITY
   ID="1"
   DESCRIPTION="Environment Management System"
   ESDATE="02Jan01" />

<ACTIVITY
   ID="1.01"
   DESCRIPTION="Requirements Development"
   ESDATE="02Jan01" >

   <SUCCESSORS>
          <SUCCESSOR
                SUCC_ID="1.03" />
   </SUCCESSORS>

</ACTIVITY>

<ACTIVITY
   ID="1.01.01"
   DESCRIPTION="Requirements Coordination"
   ESDATE="02Jan01" >

   <SUCCESSORS>
           <SUCCESSOR
                SUCC_ID="1.01.02" />
   </SUCCESSORS>

</ACTIVITY>

<ACTIVITY
   ID="1.01.02"
   DESCRIPTION="Site Coordination &amp; Design"
   ESDATE="13Feb01" >

   <PREDECESSORS>
           <PREDECESSOR
                 PRED_ACT_UID="1.01.01" />
   </PREDECESSORS>

</ACTIVITY>
â¦ â¦ â¦ etc.

</ACTIVITY>

</ACTIVITY>
</ACTIVITIES>
```

The keyword HIERARCHICAL has no effect on import; although, it is possible to import nested data. For example, it is possible to import the data shown in the above example regardless of whether HIERARCHICAL is specified in the import script. It should be noted, however, that on import, the nesting of data does not in itself imply a hierarchy, which must be explicit in the activity ID.

### Keyword STYLESHEET

The keyword STYLESHEET allows a style sheet to be defined, which will format the XML data when it is displayed in a browser. It would normally appear after the LITERAL_END following the XML definition, as shown in the previous example.

The text following the STYLESHEET keyword should either be a file name or a URL. If it is a local file name, indicated by no forward or backward slashes, it is interpreted as appearing in the Open Plan global directory. (Therefore, if you want to use the current directory either define it explicitly using the fully qualified file name or precede the file name by ".\")

The Keyword STYLESHEET has no effect on import.

### Keyword XML_TAG

The keyword XML_TAG defines XML import or export. The keyword can appear up to twice for each table definition. The first defines the tag for the collection, while the second defines the tag for each element in the collection. (If only one is present, it is interpreted as applying to each element.)

The XML_TAG keyword cannot be used in conjunction with any of the following keywords:

- RECORD_TYPE
- FIXED
- HEADER
- MPX_CALENDAR_DEFINITION
- MPX_CALENDAR_HOURS
- MPX_CALENDAR_EXCEPTION

All XML documents must have a root element that contains everything else.

### Keyword FIELD

If the XML_TAG keyword has been specified for a particular table, the second parameter on the FIELD statement, if present, contains the XML attribute name. It may be omitted if this is the same as the Open Plan field name.

On export, blank character string attributes are not exported.

On input, it is not necessary for the input file to contain all the defined attributes for every element (for example, some activities could have descriptions and others not), but there has to be at least one attribute specified or no record will be created. (Even the ID can be missing, making use of the new auto-numbering feature, but this is no use if you want to specify relationships.)

Attributes that appear on the input file but are not defined in the script (which incidentally includes any attributes associated with the collection as a whole, that is with the first of two tags defined for a given table) are ignored. There is no log message.

On input, relationships cannot be created prior to both activities. If possible, the relationships should appear after all the activities. However, if predecessors or successors need to be specified as belonging to the activity element, it is necessary to make sure the activities are in a suitable order. (Alternatively, it is possible to specify predecessors and successors for each activity, in which case half of them work and the other half result in messages on the log.)

### Keyword LINK

The LINK keyword embeds the table inside the element from the parent table. For example, the set of resource assignments might belong to the activity element. A special form of the LINK statement:

```
LINK PRJ
```

enables the elements in a table to be embedded inside the project element, which would normally be the root element. (All XML documents must have a root element that contains everything else.)

> **Note:** In a valid XML file, all the data must appear within the root tag, which in Open Plan's case would normally be the tag associated with the PRJ table. Therefore, every table apart from the PRJ table must contain a LINK keyword, linking either to the PRJ table or to a previously-defined table.

### Keywords LITERAL_HEADER & LITERAL_FOOTER

Literal headers and footers can be defined outside of the scope of a table definition. This is not specific to XML but facilitates the inclusion of the XML declaration and other heading information in an XML output.

### Import/Export Considerations

1. The offending data in the log messages may not be on the line being processed and the line being processed may not be at all unique.

2. On input, you can nest top-level tags within other tags (for example, activities within a parent activity) and it works, but this does not itself imply a hierarchy. The hierarchy must be implied in the ID.

3. On export, there is no way to nest activities within other activities.

4. On import, log messages in general may not be as useful as might be desired. In particular, since carriage return/line feed has no significance in an XML file, the line that is displayed as being in error may not be the original cause of the error.

### XML Example 1

The following script produces output like that shown on the next page:

```
EXPORT XML XML Export
LITERAL_HEADER
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
LITERAL_END

TABLE PRJ
XML_TAG PROJECT

TABLE ACT
XML_TAG ACTIVITIES
XML_TAG ACTIVITY
LINK PRJ
FIELD ID ID
FIELD ACT_DESC DESCRIPTION

TABLE REL
XML_TAG PREDECESSORS
XML_TAG PREDECESSOR
LINK SUCC_ID
FIELD PRED_ACT_UID PRED_ACT_UID

TABLE REL
XML_TAG SUCCESSORS
XML_TAG SUCCESSOR
LINK PRED_ACT_UID
FIELD SUCC_ID SUCC_ID
```

Notes:

1. A line that introduces the file as an XML file and specifies the version introduces the export file. (This is just a literal string to Open Plan.)

2. The next tag defines the root element PROJECT. (It is not strictly necessary in this case because the root element could be ACTIVITIES, but this would not work if we wanted, for example, to output resource pool information, which would have to be part of the PROJECT element.)

3. In this example, we are exporting both successors and predecessors, which seems redundant. However, for re-importing to Open Plan this is a good idea since it ensures that all relationships are imported regardless of the order of the activities. (Another way to handle this would be not to link the relationships to the tasks, which is another scenario where you would need the PROJECT element as the root.)

4. Clicking on the XML file will invoke your web browser and display the information in a hierarchical format. The format can be greatly enhanced by defining a style sheet, which can be referenced as part of the literal header.

The following example shows the output produced by the previous script:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<PROJECT>
<ACTIVITIES>

<ACTIVITY
   ID="1.01.02"
   DESCRIPTION="Site Management" >

   <SUCCESSORS>
            <SUCCESSOR
                 SUCC_ID="1.01.01" />

   </SUCCESSORS>

</ACTIVITY>
â¦..
etc.
â¦..
</ACTIVITIES>
</PROJECT>
```

### XML Example 2

The following script produces output like that shown on the next page:

```
LITERAL_HEADER
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
LITERAL_END

TABLE PRJ
XML_TAG PROJECT

TABLE ACT
XML_TAG ACTIVITIES
XML_TAG ACTIVITY
LINK PRJ
FIELD ID ID
FIELD ACT_DESC DESCRIPTION

TABLE REL
XML_TAG PREDECESSORS
XML_TAG PREDECESSOR
LINK PRJ
FIELD SUCC_ID SUCC_ID
FIELD PRED_ACT_UID PRED_ACT_UID
```

Notes:

1. Note that this time we definitely need the Project tag, which was optional in the previous example. It is this which makes the collection of activities and the collection of relationships all part of a single root.

2. Note the use of `&amp;` for an ampersand in the original description ="Req. Coordination & Planning" of activity 1.01.01. XML uses certain characters for specific purposes, and represents these characters by a sequence beginning with an ampersand and ending in a semicolon. The ampersand itself is one of these characters. Open Plan translates these automatically. The complete list of special characters recognized by Open Plan is:

   - `&amp;` for &
   - `&lt;` for <
   - `&gt;` for >
   - `&quote;` for "
   - `&apos;` for '

```xml

# Extensibility

## Adding Utilities to the Open Plan User Interface

The AddIns.dat file is a script that lets you add custom tools to the Open Plan Add-Ins tab. These tools enable you to launch up to 30 external applications from within Open Plan. To add options, select Edit AddIns.DAT on the Add-Ins tab.

An AddIns.dat file may be located in two folders:

- Modifying the copy of the AddIns.dat file in the same folder as the Open Plan executable file creates tab items accessible to all users of the same installation of Open Plan. This copy of the AddIns.dat file is installed by default.

- Modifying the copy of the AddIns.dat file located in your Open Plan User folder creates tab items that are accessible only to you. While this copy of the file is not installed by default, you can create it by copying the AddIns.dat file located in the Open Plan executable folder and pasting it into your User folder.

The tools are composed of commands in strings within the AddIns.dat file. The strings contain a description, location of the file, and parameters. The following format is used when creating custom tools:

**Tool1â¦**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Location | AddIns.dat |
| Type | String |
| Description | A ribbon group name, application description, filename, and optional parameters â formatted as follows: Tool1=Group:Label;Drive:\Path\Filename %A %P %M |

The Group is used to organize similar Add Ins in the ribbon menu.
The Label represents the tab text for the application.

Any number of the following automatic parameters can be passed to the application. Open Plan supplies these parameters on the command line when launching the application.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| %P | The currently selected project (View or Open Plan Explorer) |
| %S | The currently selected project in Open Plan Explorer |
| %A | The currently selected Activity ID |
| %R | The currently selected Resource file (View or Open Plan Explorer) |
| %r | The currently selected resource |
| %b | The currently selected code |

> **Note:** The Edit AddIns.Dat tool on the Add-Ins tab will open the AddIns.dat file in a text editor.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| %B# | Passes the name of the code file in the position # in the active open project. |
| %C | The currently selected Calendar name (View or Open Plan Explorer) |
| %c | The currently selected calendar |
| %U | The currently logged in user's ID |
| %W | The encrypted password for the current user |
| %V | The current view |
| %E | Launch the file/link in an external Internet browser window. |
| %I | Allows Internet browser to open within an Open Plan window. If the %I is specified, Open Plan formats the other parameters as a URL query string (for example, %P and %A will be passed as ?P=ProjectName&A=ActivityId). |
| %T | When %I is used, tiles the internal browser window. |
| %X | Maximizes either an internal or external browser window. |
| %D | Instructs Open Plan to execute the WebWindow in a docked window. The position of the docked window can be further specified by using parameters: DOCKSIDE=[TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT] DOCKLENGTH=[Length or width specified in pixels] |
| %Z | Information following this parameter is to be passed as a web parameter. |
| %M | Multiple instances of the add-in may be run concurrently. |
| <SYSDIR> | Open Plan System Directory: Deprecated Syntax |
| <USERDIR> | Open Plan User Directory: Deprecated Syntax |

> **Note:** If data specific parameters are used, Open Plan will reload the page that was initially loaded in the internal window with an updated query string each time the selected value (project, activity ID, resource, etc.) changes.

> **Note:** There must not be a space between the %Z and the parameter being passed. For example:
> 
> Good: "%Zpage=22"
> 
> BAD: "%Z page=22"

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| %SYSTEMDIR% | Open Plan System Director (Location of OPP30.EXE) |
| %USERDIR% | Open Plan User Directory (Location of Open Plan user files) |
| %APPLICATIONDIR% | Open Plan Application Directory (Location of Config.dat) |
| %LOGDIR% | Open Plan Log Directory (Location of Open Plan log files) |
| %WINUSERNAME% | Windows User Name |
| %OPPUSERNAME% | Open Plan User Name |
| %OPPUSEREMAIL% | Open Plan user Email (From the Open Plan User account) |

Once you have saved an Add-Ins tool, click Reload Add-Ins on the Add-Ins tab to refresh the tab. You can execute the new tool by either:

- Clicking it on the Add-Ins tab
- Pressing the keyboard shortcut if one has been defined for the item

**Examples:**

```
Tool1= System:Renumber Activities;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbapps\Renumber\actrenumber.exe %P
Tool2= System:Deltek;www.deltek.com/ %I
Tool3=System:Edit AddIns.Dat;notepad.exe %SYSTEMDIR%\addins.dat
```

## Defining Calculated Fields

User-defined calculated fields allow you to calculate and display data not stored in the standard versions of the project database tables. With calculated fields, you can extend the flexibility of any view by displaying data that is the result of a custom calculation.

> **Note:** The macros <USERDIR> and <SYSDIR> may be used to shorten the path names given for the executables or documents.

> **Note:** The copy of the AddIns.dat file opened depends on whether or not the item is to be accessible to all users of the same data source or to an individual user. If the custom item is to be accessible to all users of the same data source (shared items), the copy of the file should be stored in the same folder as the Open Plan executable file. If the custom item is to be accessible only to one particular user (user specific items), the file should be stored in that user's Open Plan User folder. Tools in the user's file will be added to the end of the list of shared tools and their positions will be moved down automatically. For example, if the last tool in the shared file is Tool10, then Tool1 from the user file will become the 11th tool.

After you have defined a calculated field, you can select that field as a column in a spreadsheet view or display it in an activity box just as you can any standard field. You can also include calculated fields in custom filter and sort expressions.

The expression for a global edit uses the same elements (constants, field names, and functions) as calculated field definitions.

### The Elements of Calculated Field Expressions

An expression defining a calculated field can include the following elements:

- Constants
- Field names
- Functions
- Other calculated fields
- Mathematical operators
- Character operators
- Duration operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- User-Defined Variables

This section discusses each of the elements of a calculated field expression with the exception of functions, which are discussed in the following section.

### Constants

You can include text, date, numeric, and logical constants in a calculated field expression according to the following guidelines:

| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Text | All text must be enclosed in either single or double quotes. For example: "Programmers" 'Phase I' |
| Dates | Dates must be enclosed in curly brackets ({ and }) and can be expressed in any valid date format. For example: {01JAN01} {12/01/01} |
| Durations | Durations must be enclosed between pipe characters ( \| ) and can be expressed in any valid duration format. For example: \|4h\| \|3.5d\| |
| Numerics | Numeric constants can include any positive or negative value and can appear with or without decimal places. For example: 1, 320000, 12.1, â123.78 |
| Logical Values | Valid logical constants are as follows: [TRUE] [FALSE] |
| Enumerated Values | Values for enumerated fields (that is, fields with a limited number of valid values) must be enclosed between square brackets ([ and ]). For example, an expression can include references to any of the possible values for the Act_type field: [ASAP] [ALAP] [Start Milestone] [Finish Milestone] [Discontinuous] [Subproject] [Hammock] [Effort Driven] [External Subproject] You can include text, date, numeric, and logical constants in a calculated field or global edit according to the following guidelines: |

Open Plan recognizes the following enumeration types:

- ACTS â Activity Status
- ACTT â Activity Type
- BOOL â Boolean
- CRIT â Critical Flag
- CURV â Curve
- DISTâ Risk
- EVTE â Earned Value Technique
- LOGI â Activity Logic Flag
- PRJS â Project Status
- PROG â Progress
- RELT â Relationship type
- RESC â Resource class
- RSCL â Resource scheduling type
- TARG â Target type

When including a field in an expression for a calculated field, you must enter the name of the field and not the descriptive name that is displayed in spreadsheet column headings. For example, if you want to define a calculated field expression that references the field containing early start dates, you must identify the field as ESDATE, not Early Start.

If you need to refer to fields stored in tables other than the primary data table, use the name of the linking field, followed by a period (.) and the field name in the linked table. For example:

- C1.DESCRIPTION â the description for a code stored in the C1 field.
- RES_ID.DESCRIPTION â the description for a resource ID stored in the Res_ID field.

### Other Calculated Fields

Expressions defining calculated fields can include references to previously defined calculated fields.

### Mathematical Operators

You can include the following mathematical operators in a calculated field expression:

- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)
- Group (( ))
- Exponentiate (^ or **)

Expressions containing mathematical operators are evaluated according to the normal rules of precedence:

- Grouping operations are performed before multiplication and division operations.
- Multiplication and division operations are performed before addition and subtraction operations.

### Character Operators

You can include the following character operators in a calculated field expression:

- Concatenate (+)

> **Note:** If you display the list of available tables and fields by clicking Fields on the Calculated Field Expression dialog box, linking fields are distinguished by a double chevron (Â») next to the field name.

> **Warning:** A calculated field cannot include a reference to itself.

- Is contained in ($)

The Is contained in operator returns a logical result.

### Duration Operators

You can include the following duration operators in a calculated field expression:

- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)

You can use these operators in expressions involving durations as follows:

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration + Duration | Duration |
| Duration + Date | Date |
| Duration â Duration | Duration |
| Date â Duration | Date |
| Duration / Duration | Decimal |
| Duration / Number | Duration |
| Duration * Number | Duration |

### Relational Operators

Expressions for calculated fields can include the following relational operators:

- Equal to (=)
- Not equal to (<>)
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
- Contained in ($)

### Logical Operators

You can include the following logical operators in a calculated field expression:

- AND
- NOT
- OR
- AND NOT
- Group (())

### User-Defined Variables

When Open Plan parses a calculated field (CF) expression, it optimizes the expression internally by looking for multiple occurrences of a subexpression and replacing these occurrences with an internal variable. For example, let's say you have defined another CF called "TimeNowPlusFive":

```
Timenow() + |5d|
```

You then use this CF in another CF:

```
IIF(EFDATE > TimeNowPlusFive, TimeNowPlusFive, EFDATE)
```

Internally, Open Plan will evaluate the TimeNowPlusFive CF only once for a particular cell, and use the result of this evaluation each time the same subexpression is encountered within the CF. In order for Open Plan to perform this optimization, each occurrence of the subexpression must be identical in terms of capitalization and spacing (for example, "EFDATE > ASDATE" is not the same as "efdate     >     asdate"). This optimization is performed automatically and assures efficient evaluation provided that the user has been consistent as explained above in the use of subexpressions that occur multiple times.

Open Plan also provides a second, more pro-active way for the user to write a CF expression by using variables. Two advantages of using this second option are that 1) the expression becomes much more readable and easier to maintain, since redefining the variable needs to be done in only one place, and 2) the parsing of a very complicated expression that contains variables takes less processing time than the same expression using repeated subexpressions.

These are the rules for using variables within a CF:

- Variables are defined above the main CF expression and are contained within a BEGIN VARIABLES/END VARIABLES block.
- Each variable definition must be on its own line.
- The result type of a variable definition (for example, character, duration, integer, decimal, date, finish date, and logical) is determined automatically by Open Plan.
- Variable names should not contain spaces or be identical to field names, function names, or other items used within Open Plan where ambiguity may occur. For example, a variable named "123" could be confused with a numeric value. "act_id" would be confused with the Open Plan field of the same name.
- Variables are not case sensitive.
- The format for a variable definition is: <variable name> = <variable expression>.
- The definition of a variable expression may reference other variables, but referenced variables must have been previously defined.

Here is an example of a CF containing a variable block. Note that the previously defined variable X is included in the definition of variable Y:

```
BEGIN VARIABLES
X = DATEDIFFERENCE(ASDATE, TIMENOW())
Y = IIF(x<=|2d|, IIF(x<=|1d|, 2, 1), -1)
END VARIABLES

IIF(Y>0, "OK", "Warning")
```

## Calculated Field Functions Reference

### ABS()

**Purpose:** Returns the absolute value of a numeric variable.

**Data type:** Decimal or integer

**Syntax:** `ABS(<value>)`

**Where:** `<value>` is a numeric variable

**Example:** If y contains the value [4] or [-4], the statement:
```
ABS(y)
```
returns the value [4].

### BASELINE_FIELD()

**Purpose:** Returns a field from the baseline directory table (OPP_BAS) record associated with the first, second, or third selected project baseline. Note that this function may be used with any table whose records can be associated with a project. This includes the Project Directory, Activity, Relationship, Assignment, Cost, Risk, and Subproject tables.

**Data Type:** Native type of field requested.

**Syntax:** `BASELINE_FIELD(<SelectedBaselineIndex>, <BaselineFieldName>)`

**Where:**
- SelectedBaselineIndex is a number between 1 and 3 indicating from which of the selected baseline objects the data is to be retrieved (note that "0" is also accepted, and will return the same results as "1").
- BaselineFieldName is a single or double quote delimited field name indicating the field to be returned. Fields that might be of interest include "BASETYPE" (0 = early, 1 = late, 2 = schedule), "BAS_ID" (baseline name), and "DESCRIPTION."

**Example:** `BASELINE_FIELD(1, "DESCRIPTION")`

If the baseline selected at index 1 for the current project is "PMB,"the returned string would be "Performance Measurement Baseline."

### CDOW()

**Purpose:** Returns the full day of the week (for example, Tuesday).

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `CDOW(<date>)`

**Where:** `<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 (Tuesday), the statement:
```
CDOW(ESDATE)
```
returns the value Tuesday.

### CMONTH()

**Purpose:** Returns the full month of the year (for example, October).

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `CMONTH(<date>)`

**Where:** `<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example:** Assuming ESDATE is 07OCT04, the statement:
```
MONTH(ESDATE)
```
returns the value October.

### CTOD()

**Purpose:** The Calendar to Date function converts a character string to a value with a DATE data type. This is useful in calculated field expressions where we want to coerce the result of an operation to type DATE.

**Data type:** Date

**Syntax:** `CTOD (<String Expression>)`

**Where:** `<String Expression>` is a quotation-mark delimited string with a valid date format.

**Example:** `CTOD(STR(USER_NUM01) + "/" + STR(USER_NUM02) + STR(YEAR(TIMENOW())))`

If USER_NUM01 = 12, USER_NUM02 = 31, and Time Now = 1/1/2006, the date result returned will be {12/31/2006}.

### DATE()

**Purpose:** Returns the current date.

**Data type:** Date

**Syntax:** `DATE ( )`

**Example:** Assuming the current date is October 4, 2004, the statement:
```
DATE( )
```
returns 04OCT04.

### DATEADD()

**Purpose:** Allows you to add a duration to a date and returns a date.

**Data type:** Date

**Syntax:** `DATEADD (<start date>, <duration>, <calendar >)`

**Where:**
- `<start date>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<duration>` is a duration field or user-entered value
- `<calendar name>` is the name of the calendar to be used in the calculation. This parameter is optional; if no calendar is specified, Open Plan performs the calculation using the appropriate calendar as follows:
  - If a valid calendar is attached to the project, the function uses the calendar named < Default >.
  - If no calendar is attached to the project, a 40-hour week is assumed.

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is 04OCT04, the statement:
```
DATEADD (ESDATE,|2d|, "CAL1")
```
returns 05OCT04 based on calculations using the calendar named CAL1.

### DATEDIFFERENCE()

**Purpose:** Returns the difference between two dates as a duration.

> **Note:** If the calculated field or global edit is based on the activity table, you can also specify the fieldname CLH_ID to have Open Plan use the calendar assigned to the specific activity. However, if the global edit is based on the assignment table, specify ID.CLH_ID instead of CLH_ID.

**Data type:** Duration

**Syntax:** `DATEDIFFERENCE (<date1>, <date2>, <calendar>)`

**Where:**
- `<date1>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<date2>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<calendar name>` is the name of the calendar to be used in the calculation. This parameter is optional; if no calendar is specified, Open Plan uses the appropriate calendar as follows:
  - If a valid calendar is attached to the project, the function uses the calendar named < Default >.
  - If no calendar is attached to the project, a 40-hour week is assumed.

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 and EFDATE is 08OCT04, the statement:
```
DATEDIFFERENCE (ESDATE, EFDATE, "CAL1")
```
returns 2d based on calculations using the calendar named CAL1.

### DATEFORMAT()

**Purpose:** Returns a date in a specified format.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `DATEFORMAT (<date field>, <format string>)`

**Where:**
- `<date field>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<format string>` is the date format

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is October 7, 2004, the statement:
```
DATEFORMAT (ESDATE, "%D%A%Y")
```
returns 07OCT04.

> **Note:** To perform the calculation using the calendar currently assigned to the activity or resource, set the calendar parameter to Calendar. To determine working days based on a specific calendar in the calendar file, set the calendar parameter to the name of the calendar.

> **Note:** DATEFORMAT() uses the same date formats as those used when specifying dates on the Date Scale Preferences dialog box.

> **Attention:** For a description of date format strings in Open Plan, see Views and Reports Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Date Formats Dialog Box in the Deltek Open Plan online help. This information is also available in Date Formats in Open Plan.

### DAY()

**Purpose:** Returns a numeric value 1 through 31 for the day of the month.

**Data type:** Integer

**Syntax:** `DAY(<date>)`

**Where:** `<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is 04OCT04, the statement:
```
DAY(ESDATE)
```
returns 4.

### DOW()

**Purpose:** Returns a numeric value 1 through 7 for the day of the week. The actual number returned depends on settings in the Open Plan .ini file for the first day of the week.

**Data type:** Integer

**Syntax:** `DOW(<date>)`

**Where:** `<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example:** Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 (Tuesday), the statement:
```
DOW(ESDATE)
```
returns 3.

### DURATION()

**Purpose:** Returns the number of minutes corresponding to a given duration

**Data type:** Integer

**Syntax:** `DURATION(<Duration Value>)`

**Where:** `<Duration Value>` is a duration variable or user-entered duration

**Example:** Assuming an 8-hour workday, the statement:
```
Duration(|2d|)
```
returns 960 (8 hours x 2 days x 60 minutes/hour).

### EVAL()

**Purpose:** Evaluates its string expression argument as a dynamic calculated field rather than as a string literal.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `EVAL(<exp>)`

**Where:** `<exp>` evaluates a string expression argument to be calculated as a dynamic calculated field rather than as a string literal.

**Example:** Assuming that the value of USER_CHR01 is "ESDATE" and USER_CHR02 is "EFDATE" and that ESDATE is 04OCT04 and EFDATE is 06OCT04, the statement:
```
EVAL('CTOD(USER_CHR02) - CTOD(USER_CHR01)')
```
returns a duration of 2d.

### FAIL_EVALUATE()

**Purpose:** Test for a condition that normally would cause the calculated field to return either a blank value or an invalid result (the latter would keep the remainder of the expression from being evaluated).

**Data type:** Boolean

**Syntax:** `FAIL_EVALUATE(<String Expression>)`

**Where:** `<String Expression>` is an expression in string format.

**Example:** `FAIL_EVALUATE("C25")`

If there is no code file assigned at index 25, this calculated field will return True. Note that if we substituted the expression "C25 IS_EMPTY" as an alternative to using FAIL_EVALUATE, the returned value would be True whether C25 does not exist or C25 exists but is blank.

### FISCALPERIOD()

**Purpose:** This function returns the user-defined label for a specific fiscal reporting period for a specific date.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `FISCALPERIOD(<Date>,<Reporting Calendar>)`

**Where:**
- `<Date>` is the search date to be located within a fiscal period.
- `< Reporting Calendar>` is an optional parameter (defaulting to the project reporting calendar).

**Example:** 
```
FISCALPERIOD(ESDATE) 
FISCALPERIOD(ESDATE, "REPORTING_CALENDAR_NAME")
```

The function returns the LABEL field from the reporting calendar that includes the supplied date. For example, given the following DATE and LABEL fields:

| DATE | LABEL |
|------|-------|
| 01/26/2001 | Jan 2001 |
| 02/23/2001 | Feb 2001 |
| 03/23/2001 | Mar 2001 |

### FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM()

**Purpose:** Creates custom grouping heading with summary rows (i.e., the summary type for the grouping row is marked as "Heading").

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(<Expression>,<WidthInCharUnits>, <Wordwrap>,<Summarize>)`

**Where:**
- `<Expression>` is the character string to be formatted
- `<WidthInCharUnits>` is the width of the expression in character units
- `<Wordwrap>` is the numeric value 0 (no word wrap) or 1 (word wrap active)
- `<Summarize>` is an OPTIONAL argument indicating whether `<Expression>` (if not a constant) should NOT be summarized (numeric value of 0), or should be summarized (numeric value of 1). The default value is 1.

**Example:** Given the following calculated field expression:
```
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2 + " - ," 20,0,0) + 
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2.DESCRIPTION, 40, 1,0) + 
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2.< Default >,20,1,0)
```

The output in a spreadsheet grouping on C2, using the above calculated field as the Heading Field would look similar to this:

### GET_ASSGNS()

**Purpose:** Returns assignment data for an activity.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_ASSGNS(<fieldname1>[ |<fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where:** `<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Resource Assignment table

**Example:** Assuming that the resource assignments for the activity are ENG (a level 1 resource pool) and TECH.MARY (a level 2 resource), the statement:
```
GET_ASSGNS("RES_ID|RES_LEVEL")
```
It then returns ENG,1.00;TECH.MARY,2.00.

### GET_CHILDREN()

**Purpose:** Returns a list of fields from the immediate children of the current hierarchical record (activities, resources, and codes).

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_CHILDREN(<FieldList>)`

**Where:** FieldList is a pipe-delimited string containing the list of fields to be returned. Fields are separated by commas, and records are separated by semi-colons in the returned data.

**Example:** `GET_CHILDREN("ACT_ID|DESCRIPTION")`

Given an activity "1.01,"with children, "1.01.01" and "1.01.02,"the returned string would be the following:

> **Note:** Because the GET_ASSGNS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

"1.01.01,First child of 1.01;1.01.02,Second child of 1.01"

### GET_COSTS()

**Purpose:** This function returns cost records for an activity.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_COSTS(<fieldname1>[ | <fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where:** `<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Cost table

**Example:** Assuming that there are two cost records for the activity, that the actual costs are 1,000 and 4,000, and that the actual quantities are 1 and 2, the statement:
```
GET_COSTS("ACWP_CST|ACWP_QTY")
```
It then returns 1000.00,1.00;4000.00,2.00.

### GET_FIELD()

**Purpose:** This function allows users to display data from other tables or data from other records in the same table.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_FIELD (<TableType>, <UniqueID>,<FieldName>)`

**Where:**
- TableType = "Activity","Resource","Calendar","B1","B2","B3" (Selected Baseline Activity Tables), "ProjDir","CodeDir","ResDir","CalDir".
- UniqueID = a constant, expression, or field name that identifies a look-up key for the table type. Note that the only acceptable table types are those that have unique identifiers (for example, the activity ID on the activity table, or the project name on the Project Directory).
- FieldName = the field in Table TableType whose value we want returned. Note that the field name MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. Otherwise, the VALUE of the field, not the field name itself, will be passed as the argument.

**Example:** `GET_FIELD("C2,"PARENT(C2), "DESCRIPTION")`

On the Activity table, if the current Activity has a code 2 value of "1.2.1.3,"the returned string would be "1.2.1. System Engineering."

> **Note:** Because the GET_COSTS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

> **Note:** TableType = "Resource" will pull data from the "Resource Data" table.

### GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY()

**Purpose:** This function returns the value for the requested field. For a grouping summary row, it returns the value of the requested field for the first child record.

**Data type:** Same data type as input field

**Syntax:** `GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY (<TableType>, <UniqueID>,<FieldName>)`

**Where:** FieldName = the field in Table TableType whose value we want returned. Note that the field name MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. Otherwise, the VALUE of the field, not the field name itself, will be passed as the argument.

**Example:** The purpose of the GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY function is to allow the user to construct a calculated field result in a summary row that uses a break column value rather than a summary value. For example, given the following filter in a barchart (with a visibility setting of "All levels of Rollup and Detail"), with a spreadsheet pane grouped on TOTALFLOAT:

```
TOTALFLOAT > |2d|
```

The filter would evaluate to TRUE for all child rows of groupings where the TOTALFLOAT break-on value is greater than |2d|. However, the filter would evaluate to FALSE on the grouping summary rows since the value of the TOTALFLOAT field on the summary row is undefined (durations cannot be summarized). Even for a numeric or date field (which can be summarized), the filter would have to be written differently to account for a summarized value on a summary row. To work around this problem, the following syntax will give us the result we want:

```
GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY("TOTALFLOAT") > |2d|
```

### GET_NOTE()

**Purpose:** Returns an activity, resource, or code note.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_NOTE(<category>)`

**Where:** `<category>` is the name of a note category. This field is optional.

If you leave `<category>` blank, the function assumes the default category.

**Example:** Assuming that a category <Document> has been set up for an activity table, the statement:
```
GET_NOTE("Document")
```
returns the Document category note about the activity.

**Example:** Assuming that you want to use the default category for an activity note, the statement:
```
GET_NOTE("")
```
returns the default category note about the activity.

### GET_PREDS()

**Purpose:** Returns predecessor data for an activity.

**Data type:** Character

**Syntax:** `GET_PREDS(<fieldname1>[ |<fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where:** `<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Relationship table

**Example:** Assuming that the predecessor to an activity is A100 and that the relationship type is Finish to Start, the statement:
```
GET_PREDS("PRED_ACT_ID|REL_TYPE")
```
It then returns A100,Finish to Start.

### GET_RELATED()

**Purpose:** Returns a list of fields for a each member of a child collection related to the main collection. This is basically a more generic version of the more specialized functions GET_PREDS(), GET_SUCCS(), GET_ASSGNS(), etc.

Main Collection = "Resource Data"
- "PSU" (Project Summary Usage)
- "RSL" (Resource Escalations)
- "SKL" (All skill assignments for the given resource record)

> **Note:** Because the GET_PREDS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname (added when you select Fields via the Fields button) be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

- "SKR" (All skill assignments for the given skill record)

`<FieldList>` is a pipe-delimited string containing the list of fields to be returned. Fields are separated by commas, and records are separated by semi-colons in the returned data.

**Example:** Assuming that we are displaying an activity spreadsheet, and that activity "A" is the current activity, the expression below will return the activity ID and early start fields for the record that matches the activity on the first selected baseline.

```
GET_RELATED("A01","ACT_ID|ESDATE")
```
returns "A,12Oct04"

### GET_RELATED_COUNT()

**Purpose:** Returns a record count. The two parameters for the function are the related collection identifier and an optional filter. You use this primarily with activity and baseline activity tables.

**Data type:** String

**Syntax:** `GET_RELATED_COUNT(RELATED_COLLECTION_IDENTIFIER, <FILTER_ON_RELATED_COLLECTION>)`

**Where:** You can use the function with one of the following related collection identifiers:

- "CHILD" (child collection)
- "CST" (cost collection)
- "PRD" (predecessor collection)
- "RSK" (risk collection)
- "STP" (step collection)
- "SUB" (subproject collection)
- "SUC" (successor collection)
- "USE" (usage collection)

Main Collection = "Baseline Activity"
- "CHILD" (child collection)
- "USE" (usage collection)

**Example:** You might want a count of all children for a subproject activity (GET_RELATED_COUNT("CHILD")), or you may want to get a count of all predecessors for a particular activity with a relationship lag of 0 (GET_RELATED_COUNT(PRD", "REL_LAG = |0|").

### GET_RISKS()

Late:16Apr04
Sched:14Apr04
```

Notice that the NEWLINE() function has forced the Late and Scheduled dates to be moved to the next line.

> **Note:** While this function is available for both calculated fields and global edits, it is used in only calculated fields. The effect of the NEWLINE() function is displayed only in spreadsheet columns where wrapping is enabled.

> **Note:** `<value>` cannot be blank

### NUMBER_FORMAT()

**Purpose**  
Returns a formatted string from a list of parameters.

**Data type**

### ROUND()

**Purpose**  
Returns a numeric or duration value rounded to a specified precision.

**Data type**  
Decimal, integer, or duration

**Syntax**  
```
ROUND(<value>, <precision>, <type>)
```

**Where**  
- `<value>` is a numeric variable or constant
- `<precision>` is a positive or negative number. If positive, `<precision>` represents the number of decimal places. A negative precision represents rounding that occurs to the left of the decimal point, i.e., integer rounding (with the decimal point being at precision 0). A â1 represents units of 10, -2 represents units of 100, and â3 represents units of 1000 (10 to the first, second, and third powers, respectively). With a precision of â1, the last two digits of a given number will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.

You can also modify the precision of a duration using one of the following codes:
- t (minutes)
- h (hours)
- d (days)
- w (weeks)
- m (months)

- `<type>` indicates how Open Plan should round. Valid values are "up" (rounds all decimals up), "down" (rounds all decimals down), or the field can be empty (rounds up values =>.5, and rounds down values <.5) This parameter is optional.

**Example**  
The statement:
```
ROUND(458.9738, 2, "up")
```
returns 458.98.

**Example**  
The statement:
```
ROUND(orig_dur / 3.0, "d")
```
returns the original duration divided by 3.0 and rounded up to the nearest day.

**Example**  
The statement:
```
ROUND(4589, -2)
```
returns 4600.

> **Note:** The code indicating the duration precision is a string and must be placed within quotation marks.

# Processes

## Time Analysis Calculations

Although it is relatively easy to initiate time analysis in Open Plan, the actual calculations performed during the operation are, in fact, quite sophisticated. This is particularly the case in situations involving mixed calendars, different activity types, or subprojects.

To help users understand how the results of time analysis are produced in Open Plan, this section provides an in-depth discussion of the following topics:

- The topological sorting of project data
- The calculation of early dates
- The calculation of late dates
- Float calculations
- Criticality
- Subprojects
- Hammocks

> **Attention:** For a description of how to perform time analysis in Open Plan, see Project Analysis Â» Time Analysis in the Open Plan online help.

### Topological Sorting

The process of time-analyzing a project is performed in a forward pass and a backward pass through the network logic. Before performing these passes through the data, Open Plan must sort the activities into a suitable order (called a topological sort order) so that no activity is processed before any of its logical predecessors.

Open Plan automatically checks to see if a logical loop has been created in the project network whenever time analysis is performed. In most cases, the user will have to resolve the loop before continuing. There are two circumstances when a loop may be created and the user is able to continue working:

- **In a multi-user environment** â Two users sharing a network may be working on a project creating relationships at the same time. Between the two of them, they may have created a loop. The loop will not be detected while the project is still open. Once it is exited and reopened, one of the users will be asked to resolve the loop.

- **An excess of activities** â When an Open Plan project has an excessive amount of activities, Open Plan informs the user that it is switching off incremental loop detection.

In a logical loop, two activities become mutually dependent (that is, neither activity can start before the other).

### The Calculation of Early Dates

As a general rule, Open Plan calculates the early start and finish dates for each activity during the forward pass of time analysis. In this pass, no activity is considered before all of its logical predecessors. There are a number of exceptions to this general rule. For example, the early dates of as-late-as-possible (ALAP) activities and of subprojects may be modified during the backward pass, which is done in reverse topological sort order. The following discussion describes the initial calculation of early dates for all activities during the forward pass, while noting that in certain cases the dates calculated here might be subject to revision during the backward pass.

The early start date of an activity is determined by the following considerations:

- The status date (Time Now)
- Any target start date with one of the following types:
  - Not Earlier Than
  - On Target
  - Fixed Target
- Any project target start date
- Any predecessor relationships leading into the start of the activity
- The early start of a parent activity, if applicable

The early finish date of an activity, on the other hand, is determined by the following considerations:

- The early start date in combination with the remaining duration
- A target finish date with one of the following types:
  - Not Earlier Than
  - On Target
  - Fixed Target
- Any predecessor relationships leading into the finish of the activity
- For subprojects, the early finish dates of all child activities

In general, the date calculated by Open Plan will be the latest date resulting from any of the above considerations.

#### The Effect of Durations

It is possible for the calculation of early dates to be affected by the activity duration. This is due to the fact that the time interval between the early start and early finish of an activity, as measured in the calendar assigned to that activity, can never be less than the remaining duration of the activity. In addition to that restriction, the interval between an early start date and an early finish date must be exactly equal to the duration for activities that are not in-progress, discontinuous, or subprojects.

To keep this interval from exceeding the durations, Open Plan will delay the early start of these activities due to delays to the early finish. Consequently, both the early start and finish dates must be determined for such activities before any successors may be processed, even if these successors depend only upon the start of the predecessor activity.

For discontinuous activities, hammock activities, and subprojects, the effect of durations on the calculation of early dates is less restrictive. For discontinuous activities, Open Plan interprets the duration specified on the activity record as a minimum duration for the purpose of calculating early dates. This interpretation allows the start and finish dates of the activity to move relative to one another. As a result, it is possible for the interval between the early start and the early finish dates of a discontinuous activity to exceed the assigned duration.

For subprojects and hammocks, Open Plan ignores the duration specified on the activity record. Instead, Open Plan recalculates the duration as the interval between the early start and finish dates implied by the child activities (after taking the activity calendar into account).

#### The Effect of Relationship Information

Relationships in networks can be one of four types: finish-to-start (the most common), start-to-start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish. Each relationship can also include a lag and a calendar.

The lag on a relationship determines a minimum interval between the two events. For example, a finish-to-start relationship between activity A and activity B with a lag of 10 days means that activity B cannot start until 10 working days after the finish of activity A. By default this lag is interpreted using the calendar of the successor, but you can assign a different calendar to the relationship.

You can also define a lag as a percentage by following the numeric value with a percent sign (for example, 50%). Open Plan interprets this type of lag value as a percentage of the predecessor activity duration that must be complete before the successor can start.

#### The Effect of Calendars

All the calculations of early dates are based on the allowable working periods for the calendar of the activity or relationship in question.

There can be additional delays due to successive activities using different calendars. For example, suppose an activity using a 5-day week (Monday through Friday) has a predecessor that finishes on a Friday or Saturday. Assuming no lags, the later activity will not start until Monday. This situation can impact later activities regardless of their calendars.

A particular problem concerning calendars occurs when there is a finish-to-finish relationship between two activities on different calendars and when the predecessor has an early finish during a non-working period on the successor's calendar. For example, assume that activity A is on a 7-day per week calendar and finishes on a Saturday, while activity B is on a Monday-through-Friday calendar. In this situation, Open Plan will set the early finish date of activity B to the next valid work time plus a single time unit based on the minimum calculated duration defined for the project. Thus, if the minimum calculated duration for activity B is set to 1 hour, Open Plan will calculate the early finish date for activity B as 9:00 A.M. on Monday, assuming the workday begins at 8:00 A.M.

There is an analogous situation with start-to-start relationships when the successor activity has a late start during a non-working period for the predecessor. In this case, Open Plan will force the activities to start at a time that is acceptable to the predecessor's calendar.

> **Attention:** For information on setting the minimum calculated duration for a project, see Working with Projects Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Project Properties Dialog Box Â» Preferences Tab in the Open Plan online help.

#### The Modification of Early Dates

There are some cases in which Open Plan may modify the early dates after the forward pass is complete. (Note that this means that these modifications do not impact successor activities.) These special cases are as follows:

- Any start milestone activity will have its early finish date set equal to its early start date.
- Any finish milestone activity will have its early start date set equal to its early finish date.
- Any ALAP activity or subproject may have its early dates modified during the backward pass.

#### Substituting Actual Dates for Early Dates

Open Plan provides an option for replacing calculated early and late dates with actual start and finish dates for progressed and completed activities once time analysis is complete. This option has no effect on the calculations performed by time analysis. It is provided to simplify reporting when it is desirable to sort activities using either early or actual dates, depending on the status of the activity.

The use of this option may inhibit the diagnosis of certain scheduling problems. For example, when the option is disabled, the early dates calculated for progressed activities refer to only the remaining portion of the work, making it relatively easy to see where out-of-sequence progress has been recorded. By default, this option is enabled. You can disable the option by changing a setting on the Options tab of the Time Analysis dialog box.

### The Calculation of Late Dates

Open Plan calculates late dates during the backward pass of time analysis. The backward pass processes the activities in reverse topological sort order so that no activity is considered before any of its successors. Working back from the project completion date, it is thus possible to calculate the latest date on which each activity needs to be finished and hence, the latest date by which the activity must start.

The project completion date used as a starting point for the backward pass depends upon a number of factors. For the project as a whole, this completion date is initially determined as the latest early finish date calculated during the forward pass.

This completion date may then be modified if the user has specified a project target finish date. The interpretation of this date also depends upon the target type as follows:

- **On Target** â The project target finish date is used instead of the calculated project finish date.
- **Not Earlier Than** â The project target finish date is used only if the calculated project finish date is earlier.
- **Not Later Than** â The project target finish date is used only if the calculated project finish date is later.

A final consideration arises if the multiple ends processing option has been specified on the Advanced tab of the Time Analysis dialog box. In that case, Open Plan treats each end activity as if the activity had a target finish equal to its early finish. This can result in a different starting point for the backward pass from each end activity.

> **Attention:** For information about the multiple ends processing option, see Project Analysis Â» Time Analysis in the Open Plan online help.

Once the project completion date has been determined, the calculation of late dates during the backward pass proceeds in a manner entirely analogous to the calculation of early dates during the forward pass.

#### The Calculation of ALAP Dates

During the backward pass, Open Plan determines whether each ALAP activity could be started later than its early start date without impacting the start dates of any successors. If this is the case, the early dates are made later until this is no longer the case. In practice, this operation amounts to calculating the free float and then, for ALAP activities only, changing the early dates so as to consume this float.

Because this is done during the backward pass, a series of consecutive ALAP activities may all have their dates modified. It is not until Open Plan has examined the last in the series that it knows whether the next-to-last can be made later, and so on.

#### The Modification of Late Dates

Cases in which the late dates calculated during the backward pass are subject to subsequent modification are as follows:

- Any start milestone activity with a zero duration will have its late finish date set equal to its late start date.
- Any finish milestone activity with a zero duration will have its late start date set equal to its late finish date.
- Any subproject may have its late dates modified.

### Float Calculations

Open Plan calculates the following six float values during time analysis:

- Total float
- Free float
- Finish total float
- Finish free float
- Relationship total float
- Relationship free float

Each type of float is discussed in the following sections.

#### Total Float

Total float is simply the difference between the early and late start dates, measured in working periods of the activity calendar. In the absence of target dates and multiple calendars, there is at least one path through the project with exactly zero total float, with all other activities having zero or positive total float.

Imposing unattainable target finish dates or an unattainable project completion date complicates the issue by creating negative float. Negative float appears in cases where the late dates are earlier than the corresponding early dates.

Multiple calendars may also complicate the issue by generating additional float. For example, an activity using a 7-day work week and ending on a Saturday may have 1 day of total float simply because the calendar on the next activity prevents it from starting until Monday.

#### Free Float

Free float measures the maximum delay for an activity that does not cause the delay of any subsequent activity beyond its early dates. In the absence of finish targets, free float is always less than or equal to total float. Unlike total float, however, free float can never be negative.

#### Finish Float

In addition to the calculation of total and free float based on start dates, Open Plan also calculates values for finish total float and finish free float. For most activities, float calculated from either start dates or finish dates yields identical results. For discontinuous activities and subprojects, changes in the calculated duration can result in one float value being computed from the difference between early and late start dates and a different float value being computed from the difference between early and late finish dates.

#### Relationship Float

Open Plan also calculates both total and free float for each relationship in the network. Relationship total float is the amount by which the lag on a relationship would have to be increased to cause a delay in either the project completion or a late target date.

Relationship free float is the amount by which the lag on a relationship would have to be increased to cause the delay of a successor activity. This value can be used to determine which relationship is responsible for controlling the critical status of the successor activity.

### Criticality

The concept of criticality is closely related to float. In the simplest case, an activity is usually defined as critical if its total float is zero. Real life situations can be more complicated. During time analysis, Open Plan calculates a field named Critical Flag that is very useful in reporting. (Of course, you can always report on criticality using the various float fields themselves if you wish.)

The Critical Flag field can have one of the following four values:

- **Critical** â The activity is not complete and has a total float that is zero or negative but is greater than the lowest total float in the network.

- **Most Critical** â The activity is not complete and has a total float that is zero or negative, and is also equal to the lowest total float in the network.

- **Controlling Critical** â The activity, while not critical itself, controls a successor with some type of critical status (that is, the Critical Flag field of the successor is set to either Critical, Most Critical, or Controlling Critical). This occurs, for example, if an activity with a 7-day per week calendar finishes on a Friday and its successor is constrained to work Monday through Friday only. The successor will start on the following Monday, and even if this successor has zero float, the predecessor will have two days of float.

- **Not Critical** â All other activities, including completed activities.

As a result, using the Critical Flag field to determine criticality differs from simply checking to see if total float is equal to or less than zero in the following ways:

- The Critical Flag field automatically checks both the start and finish total float values and uses the smaller of the two.
- Completed activities are not flagged as critical.
- In cases where there are many activities with negative float, it is possible to identify activities that have the minimum total float for the entire project.
- It is possible to identify activities that control the critical path in the network but which have more float purely because of the interference of calendars.

### Time Analysis and Subprojects

Open Plan allows you to specify relationships between activities at any subproject level or between activities on different subproject levels. You can also specify relationships between activities that are in different subprojects. The richness inherent in this capability raises questions as to exactly what the calculated dates for subprojects might mean in certain circumstances. The following sections explain how Open Plan performs these calculations with regards to both internal and external subprojects.

#### The Treatment of Internal Subprojects

If an activity has been defined as an internal subproject, Open Plan treats any activities whose activity IDs start with the ID of the subproject as children of that subproject. For example, assuming the subproject has an ID of SUB1, Open Plan would treat an activity with the ID of SUB1.001 as a child of SUB1. This child activity could, in turn, be a parent of children such as SUB1.001.001. In this way, one can build a hierarchy of subprojects, the depth of which is limited only by the maximum length of the activity ID.

Because it is possible to enter relationships between different subprojects, these relationships should affect the start dates of their component activities at lower levels. In Open Plan, this is implemented during time analysis by inferring a start-to-start relationship from a parent to each of its children, and a finish-to-finish relationship from each child to its parent. Thus, no activity can start earlier than its parent, and the parent cannot finish until all its children are complete.

The flow of information during the forward pass is such that the early start dates of the children depend upon the parent while the early finish date of the parent depends upon the children. Likewise, during the backward pass, the late finish dates of the children depend upon that of the parent while the late start date of the parent depends upon the late start dates of the children.

As a result of this approach, the early and late dates calculated for subprojects may not always represent a summarization of the early and late dates of the child activities. This is due to the fact that Open Plan allows you to further constrain the children, either by means of target dates or by relationships that directly connect a child activity to an activity in another subproject. In this case, it is possible that all of the children of a particular subproject may, due to other constraints, start later than the earliest date permitted by the early start of the subproject. In such a situation, the early dates calculated for a subproject would differ from the earliest dates of the child activities belonging to that subproject. Since many planners wish to see summarized rather than calculated dates for subprojects, Open Plan has a default option to show summary dates in subprojects. You may disable this option by changing a setting on the Options tab of the Time Analysis dialog box.

#### The Treatment of External Subprojects

It is possible to open a master project without opening one or more of the external subprojects assigned to that project. In this situation, remember that Open Plan takes into account only the information that is available at the time that time analysis occurs. Thus, if you do not open an external subproject attached to a master project, Open Plan performs time analysis by treating the early and late dates stored for the external subproject as though they were On Target dates and does not write project dates back to the subproject when the processing is complete.

If a project contains a relationship to an activity in an unopened external subproject, Open Plan creates a foreign activity to represent the other end of the interproject relationship. A foreign activity acts as a placeholder activity representing the activity in a different project. Open Plan uses the following conventions when calculating dates for projects containing foreign activities:

- During the forward pass, an early date from a foreign activity is treated as though it were a Not Earlier Than target date.
- During the backward pass, a late date from a foreign activity is treated as though it were a Not Later Than target date.

The dates of the foreign activities themselves are not affected by time analysis.

If no dates exist for a foreign activity, Open Plan treats the activity as any other activity and stores a message to that effect in the session log.

### Hammock Activities

A hammock activity is used to summarize a number of activities into one activity. A hammock is used for summary reporting to measure the time difference between the early dates of two activities and is provided in Open Plan primarily because this is a feature traditionally found in project management systems. For summarizing project progress, hammocks are not as flexible as rolling up groups of activities based on a structure implicit in the activity ID or code fields.

Hammock activities, by definition, cannot affect the scheduling of other activities. Thus, the dates calculated for hammocks can play no part in the calculation of dates in the rest of the project. The early and late dates for hammocks are calculated in exactly the same manner as dates are calculated for non-hammock activities. Hammocks can have relationships to multiple start and finish activities, and some or

# Processes

## Hammock Activities

All of these can themselves be hammocks. It is not possible to have a hammock as the predecessor of a non-hammock activity.

A hammock is taken as running from the earliest early start to the latest early finish of the activities included in the hammock. Since hammock durations are determined by the activities defining the hammock, any duration information entered for the hammock by the user is ignored during time analysis. Instead, the duration of the hammock is calculated as the interval (in the specified calendar) between the start and the finish dates of the hammock activity, inclusively.

The ability to specify a calendar for a hammock provides a simple means of calculating the elapsed duration of a group of activities using different calendars.

## Link/Unlink Activities

Open Plan allows you to add and remove multiple relationships of the same type between activities conveniently using the Link/Unlink Activities dialog box. When you click the Link button, Open Plan automatically creates relationships between selected activities using the selected type, lag, and calendar. It creates links in the order the activities display on the current view.

To remove relationships between linked activities in Open Plan, click Unlink.

Select one of the following relationship types:

- Finish to Start
- Start to Start
- Start to Finish
- Finish to Finish

You can also use the Add Relationship dialog box to define relationship between activities. If relationships already exist between the selected activities, Open Plan would not allow you to modify the existing relationships.

## Logic Trace

Open Plan allows you to outline the path of activities leading to a selected activity using the Open Plan Logic Trace Facility Dialog Box tool. It walks you through project relationships to find what activities are related to a starting act.

To view only the traced logic, from the View tab select Placements and use the TracedLogicOnly filter. Use the LogicTraceOther filter to view everything but the activities in the traced logic.

## Schedule Driver Analysis

Open Plan helps you determine the most critical paths to any point in a project using the Schedule Driver Analysis tool. It allows you to specify up to 20 paths for the tool to identify. It identifies activities that are driving the dates for a target activity. It can recognize multiple paths through the activities preceding the target activity and groups the activities based on their total float. This tool does not only identify the activities directly responsible for the target activity dates but also identifies other potential controlling chains.

When you run the process, you can use the returned data to sort or filter any of the Open Plan views. In addition, Open Plan includes two views specifically designed to take advantage of the critical path data returned: a sub-sectioned barchart view and a zoned network view.

### Target Dates

To understand the activities driving the dates for a particular project, Open Plan ignores the effect of target dates on other activities in the project. In some cases, however, Open Plan still needs to consider other deliverable; thus, removing other target dates is optional.

The Schedule Driver Analysis tool works by looking at the float and status of the selected activity's predecessors. The most critical predecessor is determined and the process repeats with that activity. A path is finished when there are no more activities to follow, Time Now is reached, or if there is a change in float.

### Custom Reports

If you have the Milestones ProfessionalÂ® (MP) application installed, you can generate custom reports that take full advantage of its graphic display ability. Three report templates included with the Schedule Driver Analysis tool allow you to create the following reports:

- A Barchart report that documents all critical paths
- A separate Path Details report for each critical path you instruct the tool to identify
- A Summary Path report that summarizes the current activities on each path

## The Effect of Progress Information

The presence of progress information has the effect of complicating certain calculations performed by Open Plan during time analysis, risk analysis, and resource scheduling. This section explores the effect of activity progress information on these types of calculations and concludes with a brief description of the effects of resource progress information.

### The Effect of Progress on Time Analysis

A central concept to the approach Open Plan uses when considering progress information is that time analysis is concerned only with the remaining duration of each activity. In the case of completed activities, this remaining duration is always zero. For in-progress activities, the calculated early dates are always later than or equal to Time Now since these dates relate only to the remaining portion of the work.

There are a few additional ways in which progressed activities are treated differently from activities that have not been progressed:

- Targets start dates are ignored for in-progress and complete activities.
- Target finish dates are ignored for complete activities.
- Lags from the start of in-progress or complete activities are measured from either the actual start date or an implied actual start date.
- Lags from the end of completed activities are measured from either the actual finish date or an implied actual finish date.
- Lags that are expressed as a percentage completion of the predecessor activity are based on the date on which this percentage completion is expected to occur.
- Completed activities are set to a non-critical status.

### Activity Status and Remaining Duration

During time analysis, the main effect of progress information is to modify the duration of the activity. Normally, the remaining duration for an activity in progress will be less than its original duration. (For completed activities, the remaining duration is, by definition, zero.)

As a general rule, it is always a good practice to enter an actual start date for any activity that has been started. In addition to providing a useful historical record, the presence of an actual start date ensures that any relationship lags will be measured from that date. (In the absence of an actual start date, Open Plan uses an estimated start date, which may change from session to session as Time Now advances.) Likewise, an actual finish date should be entered when an activity is complete.

Open Plan calculates time analysis results differently depending on the options you choose on the Time Analysis Options tab:

- **Actual Date Option** â When this option is selected (the default), Open Plan displays actual dates of in-progress and complete activities (instead of calculated early and late dates) on dialog boxes and views. This does not, however, affect the time analysis calculations unless the new Observe Actual Future Dates option (see below) is also selected and actual dates occur after Time Now.

  To have Open Plan display the calculated early and late dates, regardless of activity status, clear this option.

  This allows you to see the planned restart date for in-progress out of sequence activities.

- **Observe Actual Future Dates** â When you select this option, Time Analysis respects all future Actual Start and Finish dates.

  This can be useful when your formal progress reporting cycle is long, say monthly, but you collect progress as it happens which may mean you have actual dates in your schedule that are beyond Time Now.

  For example, Time Now is 11/1. Task A is a 10-day task with a planned start on Time Now (11/1) and a planned finish of 11/14. On Monday 11/5, you report that you have finished Task A and you set the Actual Finish to 11/5.

  - If the Observe Actual Future Dates option is not selected, the system sees this as invalid because it is after Time Now. Therefore the activity is still planned to finish on 11/14 and successor activities can start on 11/15.
  - If the Observe Actual Future Dates option is selected, the system sees the activity as completed on 11/5, and successor activities can start on 11/6.

If the project is going according to plan, actual start and finish dates may be all the progress information you need. Schedule variances are a common occurrence. As a result, Open Plan offers a number of different ways for you to communicate a best estimate of the remaining duration for an activity that is in-progress. While it is recommended that these estimates be used to augment the actual dates, Open Plan also accepts these estimates (in the absence of actual dates) as an indication of progress.

There are a number of ways to indicate progress on an activity in Open Plan:

- Marking an activity as complete
- Entering an actual start date
- Entering an estimate of remaining duration, elapsed duration, or percentage completion
- Entering an expected finish date

A common practice for in-progress activities is to report an Actual Start date along with an Expected Finish date. Open Plan then calculates the remaining duration based on the Expected Finish â Time Now (or the Expected Finish â Actual Start if the actual start date is beyond time now and the Observe Actual Future Dates option is enabled). When the activity completes, you add the Actual Finish date

Because these different indications of progress can, in some circumstances, be inconsistent with one another, it may be useful to explain exactly how Open Plan determines the status of an activity and its remaining duration.

As an aid to diagnosis and reporting, Open Plan calculates two fields to summarize how the progress information was interpreted during time analysis â Computed Remaining Duration and Computed Status (Planned, In Progress, or Complete).

### Marking an Activity as Complete

Open Plan considers an activity complete if either of the following conditions apply:

- The actual finish date prior to Time Now was entered
- The activity status was changed to Complete

If an activity is marked complete by either method, Open Plan calculates the remaining duration of the activity as zero.

If no actual finish date was entered for the activity, Open Plan assumes the activity finish date to be the period prior to Time Now. If no actual start date was entered for the activity, Open Plan estimates a start date by subtracting the original duration from the actual or assumed finish date.

### Using Actual Start Dates

If an actual start date has been entered and there is no other indication of remaining duration, the elapsed duration for the activity is deduced by subtracting the actual start date from Time Now. This elapsed duration is then subtracted from the original duration to calculate the remaining duration. (Note that these calculations take the activity calendar into account.)

If the calculated remaining duration is zero, the activity is treated as complete as indicated in the time analysis session log. If the calculated remaining duration results in a negative value, the remaining duration is taken as zero and the activity is considered complete.

### Entering an Estimated Duration

Open Plan allows you to enter an estimated duration for the activity using one of three methods:

- By entering a remaining duration
- By entering an elapsed duration
- By entering a completion estimate as a percentage

If you enter a remaining duration for an activity, Open Plan assumes the remaining duration to be that value. If you enter an elapsed duration for an activity, the remaining duration is calculated by subtracting this value from the original duration.

If you enter an estimate of the activity's completion status as a percentage, Open Plan calculates the remaining duration by subtracting this value from 100 and applying this remaining percentage to the original duration. If the remaining duration calculated in this manner is zero, the activity is treated as complete as indicated in the time analysis session log.

If the actual start date is not set for the activity, Open Plan will estimate a start date by subtracting the calculated elapsed duration from Time Now, taking into account the activity calendar.

### Using an Expected Finish Date

The expected finish date is a convenient way to specify when you expect an activity to be completed. To obtain an estimate of the remaining duration from this type of progress information, Open Plan subtracts Time Now from the expected finish date (taking into account the activity calendar).

If the remaining duration calculated in this manner is zero or negative (which generally indicates that the expected finish date is before Time Now), the activity is treated as complete as indicated in the time analysis session log. In this case, the expected finish date is treated as if it were an actual finish date.

If the actual start date is not set, an implied start date will be calculated by subtracting the elapsed duration from Time Now, which is the same as subtracting the original duration from the expected finish date, taking into account the activity calendar.

Note, however, that the existence of the expected finish date does not, in itself, indicate that the activity is in progress. If the actual start date is not set and the implied start date calculated for the expected finish is after Time Now, the activity is not treated as in-progress. Instead, the expected finish date is treated as an On Target finish target date (but only if there is not an explicit finish target).

### Special Cases of Progress Information

Three special cases of progress information require additional discussion:

- Out-of-sequence progress
- Lags based on percentages
- Progress for subprojects and hammock activities

Each of these cases is discussed in the following sections.

### Out-Of-Sequence Progress

It is possible to specify that an activity has been progressed when one or more of its logical predecessors have not been completed. This is referred to as "out-of-sequence progress" in Open Plan.

Open Plan allows the user to select one of the following options for calculating dates for activities reporting out-of-sequence progress:

- **Ignore Positive Lag of Predecessor** â Ignore positive lags on relationships leading into out-of-sequence "events" (that is, the start of an activity that is marked as in-progress or the finish of an activity that is marked as complete)
- **Observe Positive Lag of Predecessor** â Observe all relationships and lags, including positive lags, leading into out-of-sequence events
- **Ignore Predecessor Relationship** â Ignore all relationships and all lags leading into out-of-sequence events (including the finish of an in-progress discontinuous activity)

If you select one of the first two options, Open Plan schedules the remaining portion of the out-of-sequence activity so as not to violate the logic of the network. For example, assume that an activity is marked as complete but has a predecessor with a remaining duration of 10 days. In this case, the early start of the out-of-sequence activity will be calculated as 10 days after Time Now. This, in turn, will affect the dates calculated for any successor of the activity.

If you enable the Actual Date Option for time analysis, all early and late dates are replaced in cases where actual dates are available. The use of this option does not change any calculations performed by time analysis with regards to out-of-sequence progress, nor does it alter the effects of out-of-sequence progress on unprogressed activities. As a result, the use of the Actual Date Option may inhibit the diagnosis of scheduling problems where there is out-of-sequence progressing.

### Lags Expressed as Percent Complete

When a relationship has its lag expressed as a percentage completion of its predecessor and when that predecessor is in progress, the date on which the successor may start is calculated as described below.

If the predecessor has already achieved the required percentage completion, the successor (in the absence of any other constraints) may start on Time Now. Otherwise, Open Plan calculates how much time needs to be worked on the predecessor before that percentage completion is realized. The successor is not allowed to start until this time has elapsed from the early start date of the remainder of the predecessor activity, even if this event is delayed due to out-of-sequence progressing.

In computing the percentage completion, Open Plan takes the elapsed duration and the remaining duration into account and, of course, performs all calculations taking the activity calendar into account.

### Progress with Subprojects and Hammock Activities

Both subprojects and hammock activities summarize data from lower levels. Their durations are calculated from the lower-level activities rather than being specified by the user, and by the same token, any progress information is also inferred from these lower levels. (In fact, Open Plan ignores any durations or progress information entered for parents or hammocks.)

The summarization of progress for parents and hammocks is reflected in the values of the Computed Status and Computed Remaining Duration fields as well as the actual start and finish dates on the activities.

The rules for summarizing progress information are similar for both types of activity. For subprojects:

- A subproject is considered to be complete if all of its child activities are complete.
- A subproject activity is considered to be in progress if one or more of its child activities are either in progress or complete.
- The actual start of a subproject is equal to the earliest of the actual starts of any of its children.
- The actual finish of a subproject is equal to the latest of the actual finishes of its children but only if all the children are complete.

For hammock activities:

- A hammock activity is complete if all of its end activities are complete.
- A hammock activity is in progress if one or more of its start or end activities are either in progress or complete.
- The actual start of a hammock activity is equal to the earliest of the actual starts of any of its start activities.
- The actual finish of a hammock activity is equal to the latest of the actual finishes of its end activities but only if all the end activities are complete.

Note that the case of subprojects is somewhat more complex than that of hammocks, as the actual dates may affect the time analysis. For example, if there is a lag on a start-to-start relationship between two subprojects, the date from which this lag is measured will be the earliest of any actual start dates of the children of the predecessor subproject.

### The Effect of Progress on Risk Analysis

In most cases, project managers will use risk analysis processing on a project that has yet to begin in order to establish its viability. Situations may arise where it is desirable to conduct risk analysis on projects that have already recorded progress in order to accurately gauge the reliability of the remainder of the project schedule. This section provides information on how risk analysis treats the effect of project progress on duration probability.

For unprogressed activities, Open Plan applies the specified distribution probability information for activity duration (that is, the distribution shape and parameters) to the original duration. Once progress has been recorded, risk analysis processing is applied only to the remaining duration of the activity.

As in time analysis, risk analysis calculations can recognize activity progress (and thus calculate the remaining duration) in a number of different ways from activity information:

- An actual start date
- An actual finish date
- The activity is marked as complete
- An estimate of the remaining duration
- An estimate of the percent of duration complete
- A value for the elapsed duration
- An expected finish date

If an activity is complete (that is, either an actual finish date has been entered or the activity has been marked as complete), the remaining duration of the activity is considered zero. There is no need to sample from the original duration probability distribution.

If an estimate of the remaining duration has been entered, the remaining duration is fixed at the value specified by the user, and again, no sampling is necessary.

Unlike standard time analysis processing in Open Plan, the results of risk analysis processing are not used to change the completion status of an activity.

### The Effect of Progress on Resource Scheduling

The existence of activity progress has a number of implications for resource scheduling. First of all, resource scheduling looks only to the future; it schedules only the remaining work and does not consider anything that occurred before the status date (Time Now). By definition, therefore, it does not schedule any resources for activities that are complete. (The network logic is retained so that if these activities have been completed out of sequence, the existence of a completed activity can affect the scheduling of subsequent activities, just as it does in time analysis.) As in time analysis, negative lags are ignored for any relationship leading into the start of an in-progress or completed activity or into the finish of a completed activity.

On the other hand, activities that are not yet started are treated in exactly the same way as they would be in an unprogressed project.

The remaining issues are, therefore, largely concerned with activities that are in progress:

- How the system interprets a resource profile relative to the remaining duration of an activity
- The implications of progress for activity splitting

### Resource Profiles for Remaining Duration

With regards to progressed activities with resource requirements, Open Plan assumes that the resource usage has been exactly as determined by the originally planned profile. In other words, Open Plan maps the original profile for each resource against the original duration, and uses the last part of that profile to match against the remaining duration of the activity.

An example will make this clearer. Assume that the activity was originally intended to take 10 days with the following resource profile:

[Resource profile example - original text references a table/figure that was not included]

Further assume that the remaining duration is now 4 days. The resource profile is assumed to be the same as the final 4 days of the original profile:

[Resource profile example - original text references a table/figure that was not included]

If the remaining duration is longer than the original duration, the original profile will be mapped onto the latter part of the remaining duration so that there will be no resource requirement for the beginning of the remaining duration of that activity. In such a case, there has obviously been a significant deviation from the plan, and one would expect to re-specify the resource requirement profile as well as redefine the activity duration.

### The Effect of Resource Progressing

If you have entered an estimate of the remaining usage of resources for an in-progress activity, Open Plan uses this estimate to determine the remaining requirement for the resource.

This occurs only if the activity is in progress. For activities that have not started, Open Plan uses the original assignment; for completed activities, the resource requirement is always assumed to be zero.

The profiling of this remaining requirement over time is done by first matching the last part of the original profile to the remaining duration, and then applying the remaining resource assignment to that profile on a pro-rata basis.

To illustrate how Open Plan does this, return to the example of a 10-day activity with the following resource profile:

> **Attention:** There is also an option to give priority to activities that are in progress, which is discussed in Resource Scheduling Calculations.

[Resource profile example - original text references a table/figure that was not included]

Again assume that the remaining duration is now 4 days and that the resource profile is the same as the final 4 days of the original profile:

[Resource profile example - original text references a table/figure that was not included]

Now assume that you have indicated that the remaining requirement for the resource is 10 units. Since the original profile specified a requirement of 8 units for that portion of the activity duration, it is necessary to increase the requirement on each day by 20 percent. This causes rounding problems, which Open Plan handles in the same manner as in the case of activity stretching. In the current example, this results in resource requirements of 4 units, 4 units, 1 unit, and 1 unit respectively over the 4 days.

[Resource profile example - original text references a table/figure that was not included]

Finally, note that there is a potential problem in that the remaining profile for a resource may be zero. Suppose, for example, that the original profile called for the resource to be used in the first 3 days of a 10-day activity, and we are now in the last 4 days. Of course, if everything had gone according to plan, the remaining requirement for this resource would be zero. However, suppose that you have entered a positive amount for the remaining requirement at this point. In such a case, Open Plan assumes that the entire amount of the remaining resource is to be used at the start of the remaining duration. (If this is not what you intend, you can update the profile to reflect a modified assignment.)

### The Splitting of In-Progress Activities

Activity splitting does not take into account any splits that may have occurred in the past since it has no way to know about these. The limit on the number of splits is, therefore, interpreted as if the previous work was all in one piece.

A potential problem can arise if it proves impossible to start the remaining part of the activity on the first working period after Time Now (which could be either because of the activity having been progressed out of sequence or because of the unavailability of resources). In this case, Open Plan splits the activity, and this split is counted toward the total number of splits allowed for the activity.

This action may affect the ability of the system to split the activity further in future scheduling. For example, assume that an in-progress, splitable activity has the maximum number of splits set to 2. If the remaining part of the activity is scheduled consecutively with the work already done (that is, on the first work day after Time Now), it is permissible to split it later if necessary. However, if the activity cannot be scheduled immediately following Time Now, a split is deemed to have taken place, and subsequent splits are not allowed.

> **Attention:** For information on activity stretching, see Resource Scheduling Calculations.

Note that such a split is inevitable and will occur regardless of the minimum split duration. In fact, Open Plan will split the activity in this circumstance even if the activity is not defined as splitable. To reduce the likelihood of this circumstance occurring, use the in-progress priority processing option when performing resource scheduling.

## Resource Scheduling Calculations

The primary objective of resource scheduling is to produce a project schedule that takes into account not only the network logic, but also the availability of resources. This is potentially a very large combinatorial problem, and no commercially available project management system claims to provide optimal solutions. Rather, they employ heuristic algorithms designed to find acceptable solutions in a reasonable amount of computing time, even for very large problems.

As with the case of time analysis, the relatively straightforward interface of the resource scheduling function in Open Plan does not adequately suggest the complexity and sophistication of the resulting calculations. This section is designed to help users obtain a deeper understanding of these calculations through discussions of the following topics:

- Resource scheduling methods
- The effects of activity and resource attributes
- The interpretation of availability and assignment data
- The effect of processing options
- Resource assignment profiles
- Controlling priorities
- Resource substitution
- Reserving resources

This section concludes with a discussion of the interpretation of resource scheduling data.

### Resource Scheduling Methods

There are two basic methods used in Open Plan resource scheduling calculations:

- **Resource-limited scheduling** attempts to schedule the project in the shortest possible time without exceeding the resource availabilities (though this can be modified selectively using thresholds).

- **Time-limited scheduling** (sometimes known as leveling) schedules the project within a specified time, exceeding resource availability where necessary but attempting to minimize the extent of any such overloads. (This also can be modified using the smoothing option.)

Clearly, if the system is able to schedule the project within the time constraints and without exceeding any of the resource availabilities (in other words, if there is no conflict between these objectives), both methods of scheduling will produce similar results. The methods differ in how they deal with any conflict between these constraints on time and resources and more particularly how they behave when a particular activity cannot be scheduled within its late dates without exceeding the available resources.

Support for resource scheduling with regards to subprojects and hammocks is limited. Open Plan takes note of the resource usage in these cases, but no attempt is made to alter the dates of such activities based upon resource availability. The resource usage is noted when the dates are known â that is, after dealing with children (of subprojects) or controlling activities (of hammocks) â and may result in overloads.

### The Effect of Activity Attributes

Open Plan supports special activity attributes to facilitate the scheduling of particular activities. Each of these strategies (splitting, stretching, and reprofiling) can be regarded as methods of improving the results of the standard scheduling algorithm by relaxing the rules in a particular way. The fourth attribute, Immediate, restricts the operations of resource scheduling by forcing Open Plan to schedule an activity as early as possible.

Each attribute is discussed in the following sections.

### Activity Splitting

If you have designated an activity as splittable, the activity can be scheduled in segments, the gaps between the segments being forced by the non-availability of a resource rather than by the calendar for that activity. This non-availability can, in turn, be due either to the originally specified availability profile (for example, using a resource calendar) or to that resource having been preempted by another activity.

An activity will be split only if it has been specified as splittable and generally only if doing so improves the scheduled finish date of that activity. (There is one exception to this, discussed at the end of this section.)

When an activity is split, it is as if the gaps between the scheduled segments simply do not exist. The total number of working periods in all the segments adds up to the specified duration, and the resource requirements for each period of its duration are unchanged. For example, if a 10-day activity is split into two 5-day segments, the resource requirement for the first day of the second segment is the same as was specified for the sixth day of the original duration.

Activity splitting is over and above any non-working periods due to the calendar of the activity. A single split segment can span such non-working periods, and the length of the segment is measured in this calendar. Obviously then, splitting an activity results in the time between the scheduled start and the scheduled finish of an activity being greater than its duration, even after taking into account the activity calendar.

The allowability of splitting is specified on an activity-by-activity basis, and the user can also control the extent of the splitting by specifying two parameters: the minimum length of each segment, and the maximum number of segments. These two parameters may seem to have similar effects. In general, it is preferable to use the first one rather than the second. The reason for this is best illustrated in another example.

Suppose an activity has a duration of 15 days, and we expect to have to split it into 3 segments. We could either limit the minimum length of a segment to 5 days or else limit the maximum number of segments to 3. With the first approach, we cannot have more than 3 segments, and we are further constrained to make them all the same length. If we use the second approach, it will generally take longer to find an acceptable solution, simply because there are more choices to consider.

In the interest of processing speed, it is generally advisable to apply a realistic limit on the minimum length of each segment of work, whether or not you also choose to limit the maximum number of segments. In the above example, you could allow a little flexibility by limiting the minimum length of a segment to 4 days rather than 5 days. In the absence of such a limit, Open Plan may make a large number of abortive attempts to schedule based on the first two segments being of length 1 day each, 1 day and 2 days, 2 days each, and so on, all of which subsequently get abandoned because the last segment is too long to be scheduled.

Note that this is especially true when the duration and the maximum number of segments get very large. Imagine an activity with a duration of 150 days that can be split into up to 30 segments. Relying solely on a limit of 30 segments may result in Open Plan doing a great deal of abortive work because of the many potential ways in which the activity can be split. Also, in each case, Open Plan cannot tell that the last segment is impossible to schedule until it has scheduled the first 29 segments. Setting a minimum length of 4 days, for example, greatly limits the number of combinations, and in particular those combinations that leave a very large residue to be scheduled as the 30th segment.

Although Open Plan will never split an activity unless the result is an earlier scheduled finish date than the date that can be accomplished without splitting, there is a possibility that an activity will not be split in such a way that it minimizes the scheduled finish date. To illustrate how this can happen, consider an activity with duration of 10 days that is allowed to be split into a maximum of 2 segments. (In accordance with our previous advice, we may also limit the minimum duration to 3 days, although with only 2 segments this limit is much less important.)

Suppose further that at the point in time when we come to schedule this activity, the resource it requires is available for 3 days, followed by a gap, then for 5 days, another gap, another 5 days, another gap, and finally for 7 days.

Open Plan will schedule the first 3 days to take advantage of the earliest availability because a 3-day split is allowed. It will then be left with a 7-day segment, which it cannot split further because it is limited to 2 segments. This second segment will have to be delayed until the resource is available for 7 consecutive days. In this case, delaying the start so that the first segment could be 5 days long would enable the second segment, also 5 days long, to be scheduled earlier. Because it does not do an exhaustive search, Open Plan will not find this better solution.

Had the split been limited only by the minimum length of each segment, the above situation could not apply. The first 3 days would be scheduled as before, then 4 days would be scheduled during the first 5-day availability period, and the final 3 days would be scheduled during the second 5-day period, resulting in a scheduled finish date 2 days earlier than the best solution possible with only 2 segments. There is no better solution, subject to the stated constraints.

In summary, it is always desirable to limit the minimum length of each segment, either in combination with a limit on the number of segments or alone. Using the length limit as the controlling limit typically improves both processing speed and schedule efficiency.

> **Note:** To see exactly how an activity has been split, stretched, or reprofiled (that is, into how many segments the activity has been split and the length of each segment), examine a resource histogram or a crosstable view based on scheduled dates. You could also look at the barchart views directly.

### Activity Stretching

Activity stretching is another strategy that can be employed to facilitate the scheduling of individual activities. If you designate an activity as stretchable, then the activity can be scheduled to use a reduced level of a resource by stretching the duration, up to a user-defined maximum.

The stretching is done on a linear basis. Stretching is only done if it will result in an earlier scheduled finish date than can otherwise be achieved. If an activity is stretched to take one extra time period, the requirements for each period are reduced by a prorated amount. This generally causes rounding problems, but these problems are resolved by Open Plan in the same way as it handles a total resource that cannot be divided exactly by the duration â namely, by keeping the cumulative usage as close as possible to the correct figure.

To see how this rounding works, suppose that an activity has a duration of 6 days and requires 5 units of a resource for a total of 30 units. If the system is unable to schedule the activity as specified, it can try to stretch the duration of the activity by 1 day (from 6 days to 7 days). The resource levels in each of the 7 days would be as follows:

- Day 1 â 4 units (30/7)
- Day 2 â 5 units ((30*2/7) â 4)
- Day 3 â 4 units ((30*3/7) â 9)

# Resource Scheduling

## Activity Stretching

- Day 4 â 4 units ((30*4/7) â 13)
- Day 5 â 4 units ((30*5/7) â 17)
- Day 6 â 5 units ((30*6/7) â 21)
- Day 7 â 4 units ((30*7/7) â 26)

Note that the stretching has not reduced the peak requirement of 5 units, so this approach may or may not help in the scheduling in this particular case. If stretching the activity to 7 days fails, the system will try stretching the activity to 8 days, and then to 9, up to the maximum number of days specified. At 8 or 9 days, the peak requirement is reduced to 4, while at 10 days the profile becomes uniform again, with a requirement of 3 units per day.

In defining the maximum stretch duration, it is desirable to make the allowable duration large enough to make a real difference, which generally (but not necessarily) means large enough to reduce the peak requirement.

Finally, note that the maximum stretch duration is still measured in the calendar of the activity, and an activity will never be scheduled or use resources during non-working periods on that calendar.

Activity stretching can be time-consuming due to the need to consider each stretched length in conjunction with each possible start date; the reprofiling technique described in the next section is both more flexible and more efficient.

## Activity Reprofiling

Reprofiling enables Open Plan to satisfy the total resource assignment for an activity in any way consistent with the availabilities. Thus a requirement of 20 man-hours of a particular resource might involve using the resource for 5 hours the first day, 8 hours the second day, and 7 hours the third day.

The user does retain some control. A maximum duration can be specified.

The reprofiled requirement cannot exceed the original requirement on a cumulative basis starting from the scheduled start.

For example, suppose that a 3-day activity requires 5 units of a resource for each day of its duration for a total of 15 units. The activity cannot be assigned more than 5 units on the first day. Suppose that there are only 3 units available on the first day and they are assigned to the activity. On the second day, the activity can be assigned up to 7 units, allowing it to catch up with the cumulative total of 10 units. Suppose that there are still only 3 units available, however, and these are assigned. On the third day, the activity will be allowed to use up to the remaining total of 9 units. If 9 units are not available, then the activity will be stretched up to the maximum duration, using the resources as they become available.

Limiting the resource usage to the specified cumulative profile is designed to prevent the first activity scheduled from simply using all the resources it needs on the first day. A user who wants to allow more flexibility can override this limit to any desired extent by modifying the resource profile itself. There is also an option on the Advanced tab of the Resource Scheduling dialog box to limit reprofiling to the original level. The most extreme case would be to specify that all the resources are required on the first day. A more sensible approach would be to increase the requirement slightly on the first day and to make a corresponding reduction on the last day.

The interpretation of when a reprofiled activity is deemed to have started can be confusing. This is because it is quite possible for the resource profile to be adjusted so that the usage is zero for the first period or for the first several periods. The system assigns a scheduled start date that may seem arbitrary but is in fact consistent with the rules described above as well as with the fact that the resource must be used during the activity duration.

This is best explained with the aid of an example. Suppose that a reprofilable activity requires a single resource at a level of 1 unit per day over its entire duration of 10 days. Suppose further that it is available for scheduling on January 1 but that the resource is not available until February 1, when it becomes available with a level of 3 units. The activity will use 3 units of the resource on each of the first 3 days of February, and 1 unit on February 4, for a total of 10 units. The scheduled finish date will be February 4, and the scheduled start date will be January 26, 9 days earlier.

Note that there is a period of 4 days during which the activity has started but no resources are used. This is more than merely a convention since the scheduled dates are the dates used to compute the start dates for the successors of the activity. The details of when an activity actually uses its resources are displayed in a histogram based on scheduled dates. As a convenience for certain reporting requirements, Open Plan also stores the date on which the first resource was used in the First Usage field on the activity table.

> **Note:** Because resource requirements can be profiled so as not necessarily to cover the start of an activity, it is possible for the first usage date to be later than the scheduled start date, even without reprofiling. Also, note that in the special case of an activity with no resource assignments at all, the first usage date is always set to the scheduled start date.

## The Immediate Attribute

Activities assigned the Immediate attribute are treated first among the list of activities that are available for scheduling at any particular point in time. If there is more than one such activity in the list, the order in which these activities are scheduled is not important, because in fact, all such activities will get scheduled on the earliest date possible regardless of whether this creates a resource overload.

In general, the Immediate attribute should be used sparingly. Its main purpose is to deal with situations where a sequence of activities needs to be scheduled without breaks between the activities. In such cases, the first activity in the string does not need to be classified as Immediate, but the remaining activities should be. As with normal activities, they cannot be scheduled before all of their predecessors, and they cannot be scheduled on non-work days. Therefore, there should typically be no other logic constraining these subsequent activities, and they would normally be on the same calendar as the first activity.

Note that although Immediate activities are scheduled without regard to resource overload, giving these activities the highest priority maximizes the probability that such an overload will be avoided, if necessary, by delaying other, lower-priority activities.

## The Effect of Resource Attributes

Three attributes assigned to resources have a potential effect on resource scheduling calculations:

- Resource thresholds
- Consumable resources
- Perishable resources

Each attribute is discussed in the following sections.

### Resource Thresholds

It is possible to combine the characteristics of resource-limited and time-limited scheduling by applying thresholds to one or more resource and then specifying a resource-limited schedule. Thresholds have no effect on time-limited scheduling as such but impart some of the characteristics of time-limited scheduling to resource-limited scheduling. In fact, it is possible to think of time-limited scheduling as entirely equivalent to resource-limited scheduling where all the thresholds are set to very high values.

A threshold is an amount by which a particular resource may be exceeded if necessary to stay within the late dates of the project, even though the resource-limited method of resource scheduling is used. When an activity cannot be scheduled within the time constraint, Open Plan first attempts to schedule it by exceeding one or more of the specified resource availabilities but only those for which a threshold has been specified and only to the extent of this threshold. If this is not possible, the activity is scheduled later, as it would be in the usual resource-limited mode.

Considerable control can be exercised over the scheduling algorithm through the use of thresholds. The user can control the extent to which resource availabilities are exceeded on the basis of each individual resource.

### Consumable Resources

Regular resources generally represent personnel or pieces of equipment that are available for duty for certain specific periods of time. If the project is unable to use all the resources available on a particular day, this usage is lost forever. For example, if there are three electricians available for a week and you employ only two of them on Monday, this does not enable you to use four on Tuesday.

Open Plan supports a special type of resource called a consumable resource. Once a consumable resource becomes available, it remains available until it is used. Consumable resources are used to model resources like materials whose unused availability can be accumulated.

The data defining the availability of a consumable resource is also interpreted slightly differently than for regular resources. The From Date is the date from which the resource is available. The number of resource units defined for the availability become available on that date and can be used at any time from that date onwards. The To Date of the availability is significant because it indicates the date after which the resource is assumed to be unlimited for the purposes of scheduling. For this reason, it is required. (If the resource availability is defined by multiple entries, the latest date is used by the system for this purpose just as with non-consumable resources.)

Consumable resources can also be created by activities. This is achieved by specifying a negative resource requirement. For example, assume that an activity has an assignment for a consumable resource of -2 units per day. The result would be that for every day of the duration of that activity, the number of available units for that resource would increase by 2.

Open Plan cannot correctly support the splitting of activities that use consumable resources. Resource may overload due to using the same availability for more than one split since Open Plan does not update the availability until the operation is complete. (For regular resources, of course, there is no conflict between different splits.) Furthermore, on a progressed project, it is important to modify the availabilities of consumable resources to indicate the true amount available at Time Now. This is because Open Plan makes no attempt to adjust these for any actual usage. Unlike regular resources, availabilities prior to Time Now are available for use on the remaining part of the project, so these should be adjusted to reflect the current situation.

### Perishable Resources

Perishable resources are very similar to consumable resources, except that the To Date on each availability record indicates the date after which the particular batch of resources cannot be used.

Typically, you could specify the availabilities of perishable resources as a series of non-overlapping contiguous periods. One example of the use of perishable resources is to model funding of projects. It may be that in each financial year, a certain amount of funding is available. If it is not used during the year, it is forfeited. This would be represented by a different availability definition for each year.

However, there is no requirement for each unit of the resource to last for the same length of time nor for the availability records to be contiguous or not to overlap. Each record can be thought of as defining a batch of the resource, which becomes available on a certain date and which expires on a certain date. Open Plan will attempt to match each resource requirement with a batch in the most efficient manner. For example, if an activity requires 10 units of a particular perishable resource on June 1, Open Plan considers only the remaining availabilities of those resources available on or before June 1 and do not expire until after June 1. Assuming that the total is at least 10 units, it will first take the earliest expiring resources from the batch and so on. If two batches expire on the same date, Open Plan will use the one that became available later.

Open Plan cannot correctly support the splitting of activities that use perishable resources. Resource may overload due to using the same availability for more than one split since Open Plan does not update the availability until the operation is complete. (For regular resources, of course, there is no conflict between different splits.) Furthermore, on a progressed project it is important to modify the availabilities of perishable resources to indicate the true amount available at Time Now. This is because Open Plan makes no attempt to adjust these for any actual usage. Unlike regular resources, availabilities of perishable resources prior to Time Now are available for use on the remaining part of the project and so should be adjusted to reflect the current situation.

## Scheduling Intervals and Mixed Time Units

In Open Plan, it is possible to define the durations of activities using time units ranging from minutes to months. This feature contrasts with many traditional scheduling systems that rely on the concept of a base time unit in which all durations are expressed.

The question of mixed time units has a direct bearing on resource scheduling calculations. In Open Plan, the availability of each resource is stored in an array, each element of which represents a uniform interval of time. During scheduling, the assignment profile for each activity is compared with the data in this array. For the activity to be scheduled, Open Plan selects a trial start date and then compares the requirements with the availabilities in each time interval. When a suitable scheduled start date is selected, the availability of the activity is reduced.

To remove the ambiguity that could arise from the use of mixed time units, Open Plan allows you to specify a scheduling interval each time you perform resource scheduling. This scheduling interval determines the granularity to which the availability will be tracked. For example, if you select days as the scheduling interval, Open Plan checks only that the resource is available within a particular day before scheduling the activity. This is true even if the activity duration is measured in minutes. A 15-minute activity requiring one person for its entire duration requires 15 man-minutes during the day (or possibly even spanning 2 days). As long as that resource is available some time during that day (or days), the activity can be scheduled. When the activity is scheduled, the resource availability for that day is decremented by 15 man-minutes, but no information is retained about any particular 15-minute interval during the day.

### The Interpretation of Availability Data

When you define the availability of a resource in Open Plan, you specify an availability level, a start and finish date for the availability, and the name of a calendar. For non-consumable resources, Open Plan interprets the data as follows: the resource is available at this level on every period between the two dates that is a working period in the specified calendar.

This sounds simple, but the lack of a natural base interval creates a situation that may require further explanation. Consider the example of a 15-minute activity discussed above. From that discussion, it should be clear that multiple 15-minute activities can be scheduled concurrently even though they all need one person and there is only one person available, provided only that the total availability during the day is not exceeded. But what exactly is this total availability? Put another way, exactly how many of these activities can be scheduled in a day?

The answer is that it depends upon the calendar specified for the availability record. If the calendar indicates an 8-hour day, then a level of 1 results in 480 man-minutes of that resource being available on each working day. (Of course, some days could have different numbers of working minutes in them, in which case the resource level on those days would differ.)

Resource availability records are additive, and of course there could be different calendars on different records.

The lack of a natural base interval creates a more serious problem with regard to thresholds since there is no calendar associated with this feature. Thresholds are therefore interpreted based upon the project default for the number of minutes in the scheduling interval. So, if you choose to schedule in days and if the number of hours per day defined for the project is 8, Open Plan translates an availability of 1 into 480 man-minutes.

For consumable resources, the level defines the number of units that become available on the start date. The finish date and the calendar are ignored, except that the finish date is used for the sole purpose of determining how far into the future to maintain usage information. The threshold represents the additional number of units that can be used in total throughout the project (that is, as if they were available at the start of the project).

### The Interpretation of Assignment Data

When you assign a resource as a level (rather than a total) requirement, this assignment is interpreted in much the same way as availability levels, using the activity calendar. Thus, a level requirement of 1 person on an 8-hour-per-day calendar translates into 480 man-minutes per day.

The difficulty with requirements comes when they are specified as totals. What does a total of, say, 5 actually mean? This could be interpreted, for example, as either 5 man-hours or 5 man-days.

To remove this ambiguity, Open Plan uses the project defaults for the duration unit and for the number of minutes in that unit. Thus, if the default duration unit is days, then a total of 5 is equal to 5 man-days. If a day is defined as 8 hours, this is interpreted as a total requirement of 2400 man-minutes.

This means that the interpretation of a total requirement will not change if the duration of a particular activity changes (for example, from 5d to 40h) but will change if the project conversion settings are altered.

For consumable resources, the problem is reversed â levels expressed as total requirements are not ambiguous, but those expressed as level requirements are. As in the case of non-consumable resources, however, Open Plan refers to the project defaults to interpret the entry. Thus, for a consumable resource, a requirement expressed as a level of 5 will be interpreted as a requirement for 5 per minute, hour, day, week, or month, depending upon the project default settings.

## Resource Assignment Profiles

It is often appropriate to assume that any resources required by an activity are required at an even rate throughout the duration of that activity. In such cases, it is necessary to indicate only the activity ID, the resource code, and the amount of the resource required each period.

In more complex situations, particular resources may be required for only a part of the duration of the activity, or the assignment may be unevenly distributed over the duration. Open Plan provides two ways of specifying such profiled assignments, and these can be used separately or in combination:

- You can specify a profiled assignment by entering multiple levels, offsets, and periods for the same resource.
- You can specify a predefined profile curve that Open Plan will use to spread the amount of the assignment.

In the first case, each assignment is interpreted as specifying a particular requirement of units for a time span starting at the start of the activity plus the offset and continuing for a specified duration. These calculations take into account the working and non-working periods defined in the activity calendar.

> **Note:** Open Plan does not permit an activity to use a resource outside the span of its duration. As a result, the offset duration of an assignment cannot be less than zero, and the combined duration of the offset and period cannot exceed the activity duration.

By combining assignments of the same resource, a profile of any desired complexity can be created. These assignments are treated cumulatively, so they can be defined to overlap if desired.

The second method of specifying a profile uses the predefined spread curves. Spread curves are defined in terms of percentages of the total to be distributed to each 10% of the duration of an activity.

The advantage of using spread curves is that it saves time, particularly if you are likely to alter the activity durations. (As offsets and periods are absolute, they generally have to be altered every time the duration changes.) On the other hand, as the curves are always defined on a 10-point scale and as activity durations will not normally be multiples of 10, the use of spread curves may produce rounding effects unacceptable to some users.

As stated above, the two methods can be used in combination, either on the same or on different requirement records. When a spread curve is specified in conjunction with an offset and period on the same record, the amount of the assignment is spread between offset and offset + period according to the indicated curve.

## The Effect of Processing Options

The potential effects of three of the resource scheduling processing options require further explanation:

- Hard zeros
- Smoothing
- Scheduling interval

Each processing option is discussed in the following sections.

### Hard Zeros

The user can specify the availability of any particular resource by using one or more settings on the Availability tab of the Resource Details dialog box. Each availability entry includes the following information:

- A start date (From Date)
- An end date (To Date)
- An availability level (Availability)
- A calendar name (Calendar)

Any number of these settings can be used to build a profile of availability. They are treated cumulatively. For example, the following two entries:

| Availability | From Date | To Date | Calendar |
|--------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 5 | 01Jan04 | 31Dec04 | <default> |
| 2 | 01Jul04 | 31Jul04 | 1 |

would signify that 5 units were available throughout 2004 using the default calendar and that these would be augmented during July by 2 more units working to calendar 1. Depending upon the definition of the calendars, this might mean that during July there would be a total of 7 units available on weekdays and 5 on weekends.

Clearly, there will be periods of time during which there is no availability defined, and it is important to understand the conventions used by Open Plan to interpret the availability during such periods.

As we will see, there are various ways in which these periods may arise, but for each resource there must always be two such periods:

- A period of time prior to the earliest start date specified on any of the resource availability records for that resource. Under no circumstances will Open Plan schedule an activity to use resources during this period. This may mean that an activity cannot be scheduled prior to its late date and will result in a fatal processing error. The solution is either to modify the availability data so as to start earlier or else modify the project start date and redo time analysis on the project.

- A period of time after the latest end date specified on any of the resource availability records for that resource. Open Plan treats the resource during this period as if its availability is unlimited. This ensures that the resource-limited scheduling will always be able to schedule a project in a finite amount of time. If Open Plan is forced to schedule activities beyond the date range over which availabilities are defined, a warning message is issued.

If there are no availability records at all for a particular resource or if the resource is not selected for scheduling during that session, the availability of that resource is regarded as unconstrained, and a warning message is issued.

It is also possible for there to be additional periods within the overall date range covered by the availability definitions during which the availability of a particular resource is undefined or zero. In fact, there are several ways in which this can occur:

- There can be gaps in dates covered by the availability definitions.
- There can be gaps due to the use of resource calendars (for example, each weekend may constitute such a gap).
- There can be availability records that explicitly define a date range and an availability level of zero. (The reason for doing this will become apparent below.)

In resource-limited scheduling and in the absence of thresholds on the resource in question, each of these situations is treated the same way. The availability is treated as zero, and activities will be delayed if necessary so as to avoid using resources during these periods.

In time-limited scheduling and in resource-limited scheduling with a threshold, it is generally permissible to exceed the availability if necessary in order to comply with the date constraints. This may or may not be appropriate when the availability is zero. For example, you may be able to vary the number of engineers assigned to a job but you may not be able to alter their Monday-to-Friday workweek. In this case, one would want to allow the availability to be exceeded during the workweek but would not want the zero availability at the weekend to be violated.

The question therefore arises as to how and when to permit a zero availability to be exceeded. Open Plan offers considerable flexibility in this, as follows:

- By default, periods of zero availability within the overall date range are treated the same as any other resource availability. In other words, they may be exceeded in time-limited scheduling; in resource-limited scheduling they may be exceeded up to the limit imposed by the threshold.

- The hard zeros processing option inhibits the use of a resource when its availability is zero, either due to a gap in the dates covered by availability definitions or due to the use of a resource calendar.

- The hard zeros option can be overridden in specific periods by explicitly defining a period with zero availability.

Care should be taken when the hard zeros option is used, particularly in conjunction with resource calendars, as its use may make it impossible to schedule an activity within an acceptable time frame. For example, if a resource is available only on weekdays and an activity requires that resource for 6 consecutive days (which means that the activity is not on a 5-day-per-week calendar), it will be impossible to schedule that activity until after the end of the availability data. In resource-limited scheduling, the activity will simply slip, giving rise to a warning message, while in time-limited scheduling this probably will not be possible and the result will be a fatal processing error.

> **Attention:** The interpretation of availabilities, and hence of zero availabilities, is somewhat different for consumable resources. For more information, see Consumable Resources.

### Smoothing

Resource smoothing is a processing option that modifies the effect of time-limited scheduling and of resource-limited scheduling when thresholds are used. To understand the effects of this option, we first need to consider the objective of time-limited scheduling and how it attempts to achieve this objective.

Everything in this section applies equally to resource-limited scheduling with thresholds, but for clarity, we will refer only to time-limited scheduling.

The stated objective of time-limited scheduling is to minimize the sum of the maximum amounts by which each resource availability is exceeded, without delaying the completion of the project. For example, by this standard it is preferable to exceed a resource by 1 unit for 2 periods rather than by 2 units for 1 period. Similarly, it is preferable to exceed one resource by 2 units than to exceed three resources each by 1 unit.

If, during the course of resource scheduling, a particular resource availability has already been exceeded by 2 units at a particular date, then by the standards of this objective there is no cost associated with exceeding it by a similar or lesser amount at some other time. Indeed, there may be a benefit in so doing, either directly or in terms of the scheduling of subsequent activities.

The standard time-limited algorithm takes note of the extent to which availabilities have already been exceeded and makes use of these excess amounts just as if they were freely available. As already stated, to do so incurs no cost. Moreover, since this approach generally results in earlier scheduling of the activity being considered, the flexibility of the system to schedule the remaining work without further exceeding availabilities is maximized.

This algorithm sometimes gives results that do not seem "right." In particular, there is a tendency to exceed resource availabilities during periods when it appears that it was not necessary to do so.

The smoothing option avoids this problem by not exceeding any resource availability for any activity unless it is strictly necessary in order to schedule that activity. Note that this reduces the flexibility for subsequent activities and so the algorithm may sometimes perform worse by the standards of the strict objective function defined above.

The advantages and disadvantages of the smoothing option can be further illustrated by the use of two simple examples.

Consider four independent activities, all of which require the same resource:

- Activity A has a duration of 10 days, 20 days of total float, and requires 1 unit per day.
- Activity B has a duration of 10 days, 20 days of total float, and requires 1 unit per day.
- Activity C has a duration of 10 days, 20 days of total float, and requires 1 unit per day.
- Activity D has a duration of 30 days, zero total float, and requires 3 units per day for the last 10 days only.

Assume further that there is only 1 unit of the resource available.

Because there is no logic connecting these activities, any one of them could be considered first. We will assume the use of the default scheduling priorities. In other words, priority is given to the smallest total float. Hence, as activity D has no float, it will be considered first. In time-limited scheduling, Open Plan has no option but to schedule it on its late dates (which correspond to its early dates of course), thereby exceeding the available resource by 2 units.

The standard algorithm (without the smoothing option) subsequently behaves exactly as if these extra 2 units were actually available and will therefore schedule activities A, B, and C all on their early dates:

If the smoothing option is specified, however, the treatment of activities A, B, and C is different. The first to be considered (which could be any of them but assume it is activity A) is scheduled on its early date, within the original availability of 1 unit. The second activity, say B, is delayed by 10 days in order not to exceed the availability; this is acceptable, as it has 20 days float. Finally, activity C cannot be scheduled without exceeding the resource again, and this is done:

Most planners would probably prefer the "smoothed" result, even though by the standards of the stated objective, they are both equal â both solutions result in the resource being exceeded by 2 units.

The problem with the smoothing option can be seen if the example becomes slightly more complicated by assuming that there are finish-to-start relationships between activities A and C and between activities B and C â activity C cannot start until both activity A and activity B have been completed. Activity D is scheduled as before. Because of the added logic, it is no longer possible to choose freely between the other three activities; Open Plan must schedule either activity A or activity B first. Both activity A and activity B now have a float of 10 days, so the choice is again arbitrary â assume that Open Plan selects activity A and schedules it on its early date. Note that this does not free up activity C, so the next activity to be scheduled must be activity B. The strict time-limited method (without smoothing) schedules this as before on its early date.

Finally, it schedules activity C after activity A and activity B, on its early date:

When the smoothing option is in effect, the scheduling of activity D and activity A goes as before. When activity B is considered, it will be delayed by 10 days in order not to exceed the resource "unnecessarily." Note that this is permissible, as the activity has 10 days float.

Finally, when Open Plan comes to consider activity C, it will have no choice but to schedule the activity on its late date, a total delay of 20 days compared to its early date, since the scheduling of activity B has used the entire float. This requires Open Plan to exceed the resource availability by 1 more unit than would have been necessary had the smoothing option not been in effect:

The effect of the smoothing option is clearly detrimental in this case. Strict time-limited scheduling produces a lower maximum requirement, which is the prime purpose of the exercise. It is interesting to note, moreover, that this example does not depend upon the priority rule, or even upon Open Plan's choice of the strictly serial scheduling algorithm, for its effect. No algorithm that schedules activities one at a time in accordance with the network logic and that does not reconsider earlier decisions can do better with the smoothing option, though it is quite easy to make the strict time-limited option do worse (by choosing an inappropriate priority rule that would consider activity D last, for example).

### Scheduling Interval

By specifying the scheduling interval for a resource scheduling session, it is possible to define the granularity of the scheduling process over time. In cases of very large projects using large numbers of resources spread over long time periods, there may be a significant performance benefit in not scheduling to the smallest detail. On the other hand, a larger scheduling interval may introduce approximations that may or may not be acceptable.

Note that the performance benefit comes in part simply from not having to do so many comparisons in order to test whether an activity can be scheduled on a particular date. Also, because such a test is typically more likely to succeed, fewer start dates need to be tried.

For example, assume that you have defined the scheduling interval as weekly. If the resource availability definitions indicate that a particular resource is available at a level of 2 units per day on a 5-day workweek, all that is stored is that there are 10 units available during the week. During subsequent scheduling, an activity may be scheduled to use that resource during the week provided only that the total usage does not exceed 10 units, but without regard to the specific days on which the resource is required. For example, it may be that to execute the schedule actually requires 3 units on Monday and only 1 unit on Tuesday and so on. In this case, resource scheduling will produce rough estimates that may not be completely accurate in every detail.

Of course, to some extent, increasing the size of the interval used in scheduling tends to give a more optimistic answer than can actually be achieved. In the above example, for instance, there is nothing to stop an activity from using all 10 units on Monday, or even on Sunday if the activity calendar permits, even though in reality there are only 2 units available per day and they are not available on Sundays. To guard against the worst instances of this, use calendars on your activities rather than relying on resource calendars and avoid specifying requirement levels on individual activities that even in isolation exceed the availability.

If you want Open Plan to avoid approximations in its calculations, but you do not want to specify an unnecessarily small scheduling interval, it is important to determine the largest scheduling unit that does not cause approximations. In the simplest case, this is the lowest common denominator of all durations. For example, if all durations are known to be multiples of two hours, then a 2-hour interval is appropriate.

It is also important that the project calendars conform to these intervals as well. For example, if you choose a 2-hour scheduling interval, Open Plan performs resource scheduling based on elapsed 2-hour intervals starting at midnight. For working days defined as starting at 8 A.M. and finishing at 4 P.M., this interval is suitable. For working days defined as starting at 9 A.M. and finishing at 5 P.M., however, a 1-hour scheduling interval would be required.

## Priorities in Resource Scheduling

Resource scheduling in Open Plan employs the strictly serial method of determining the sequence of calculations to be performed when scheduling the activities in a project. This approach is designed to avoid the combinatorial nature of the problem by considering one activity at a time in a predefined order.

Clearly, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the way in which this order is determined, though that order is, in practice, constrained to a greater or lesser extent by network logic. The order of processing is always such that no activity is considered before its predecessors (that is, in topological sort order). There is generally more than one such order, however â the exception being when all the activities are strung end-to-end in a single chain. As a result, how ties between competing activities are resolved becomes a key concern.

Open Plan employs various rules for breaking ties. Some of these rules are always beneficial (or at least never detrimental) and are consequently employed automatically.

The strictly serial method selects activities to be scheduled by maintaining a list of those activities that are "available for scheduling" (that is, those for which all predecessors have already been selected). At the outset, this list consists of the set of start activities. From this list, the activity that has the highest priority (according to the priority rules defined below) is selected and removed from the "available" list. As a consequence of this selection, one or more of the selected activities successors may now be "available," in which case they are added to the list.

Depending upon the priority rules, the next activity to be selected is as likely to be one of the newly available activities as any of the previous candidates. This is the meaning of the term "strictly serial."

This method has been selected for Open Plan because it has been found to be the most effective in practice and also because it has certain features that seem to be worthwhile.

- In conjunction with the default priority rule based on total float, this method tends to favor the scheduling of the entire critical path before returning to schedule the next most critical activity.
- It is the method that gives the most effect to the priority rules, and therefore gives the most flexibility to users who want to determine their own rules.

### User-Defined Priorities

As explained in the previous section, Open Plan determines the processing order primarily based on network logic. There will generally be ties encountered during this process (that is, there will be points at which more than one activity is available for scheduling). Open Plan first applies certain internal rules to establish a unique choice for the next activity to be scheduled. If there is still a tie, Open Plan then applies rules controlled by the user. These user-defined rules are based on the following features:

- You can assign the Immediate attribute to an activity.
- You can give priority to any activity that is already in progress.
- You can specify up to three activity fields to be used in sequence to decide ties.

There is no particular reason why giving priority to in-progress activities should improve the quality of the schedule as such, but it may be highly undesirable to reassign a resource that is already working on an activity. If present, this option takes precedence over the other user-defined priorities.

Specifying priority fields for the session works as follows: Priority is given to the activity with the lowest value in the first priority field. If there is still a tie, the second priority field is checked, and followed, if necessary, by the third. If a tie still remains after checking all the fields referenced, Open Plan uses the activity ID as a final tie-decider in order to ensure repeatability of the results.

By default, Open Plan uses Total Float as the first priority field while leaving the other two fields blank. This default means that Open Plan gives priority to the activity with the lowest total float. This has been found to produce the best results more reliably than any other general rule, but there may be specific cases where other rules will produce a better result.

One common way of using the user-defined priorities is to allow the user to enter priority values directly on the activity record. (The Advanced tab of the Activity Details dialog box includes a field for this purpose.) It is recommended that such a user-defined priority field be used as a secondary priority field in combination with total float.

Open Plan also provides access to two special-purpose "fields" that you can select when performing resource scheduling: Hierarchical Priority and Remaining Float:

- **Hierarchical Priority** â Open Plan refers to the priority field of the parent activities when attempting to break a tie between two activities. This enables the earlier ones to increase the priority of a whole subproject.
- **Remaining Float** â Open Plan uses the activity's remaining float (that is, the difference between the late start and the earliest feasible start â this value is calculated during the course of resource scheduling) when determining priorities.

### Limitations on User-Defined Priorities

It is important to understand exactly what user-defined priorities can and cannot do. In particular, it must be noted that even in the presence of user-defined priorities, the network logic is the first consideration. Generally speaking, an activity will not be considered before its predecessors. Consider, for example, the following network:

In this example, assume that activity C is regarded as having a higher priority than the other activities. High priority is indicated by a low numeric value, so assume the priority of C is set to zero and that of the

# Processes

## Priority Rules and Scheduling Order

Despite activity priorities, Open Plan schedules activity A first because this is the only activity without predecessors. Open Plan then has the choice of scheduling either B or D. Both have a priority of 1, resulting in a tie. This tie will be decided as follows:

- On the basis of a secondary priority field, if present.
- If no secondary priority field is specified, then the tie is broken arbitrarily.

Open Plan does not look ahead at this stage and decide to schedule B first so it can get to the high priority activity, C.

If it happens that the choice is D, B will follow, then C, and finally E. So in this case, C did not benefit at all from its high priority; in such a case, the user must specify the high priority on B as well as C.

Using the default priority rule based on total float, the above situation tends not to occur because, in the absence of target activities, B and C will have the same total float. The scheduling order tends to go as far as it can down the path with shortest float, then backtrack to the next shortest, and so on.

Another point to note is that the priority rules relate to the order in which activities are considered during the scheduling process, not the order of the schedule dates that get assigned to them. Even if Open Plan schedules activity C before activity D (that is, the scheduled date of C is determined before the scheduled date of D), it does not necessarily follow that the schedule date of C is earlier. In the above example, activity D may get scheduled at an earlier date than C, even though C gets considered first for a number of reasons, among them being:

- **Activity D is available earlier.** If it does not compete with B for resources, or because it uses a different resource, or because there is plenty of availability, it may start at the same time as B, which is clearly impossible for C, however high its priority.

- **Activity C may get delayed because of a lack of resources** while activity D may subsequently be accommodated at an earlier date because it uses a different resource, uses less of the resource, is shorter, or is available to start sooner.

Because resource scheduling in Open Plan obeys the same constraints of network logic as does time analysis, it can never produce a schedule in which the project completion date is earlier than the date obtained by time analysis. In fact, time analysis can be regarded as a special case of resource scheduling in which resources are not a constraint (that is, in which the availability of all the resources is infinite).

## Resource Substitution

Several powerful features enable you to give Open Plan selective control over the specific resource that is assigned to an activity. These features include:

- **Alternate resources** that enable you to specify a resource that can be used as an alternate to the requested resource.

- **Resource pools** that enable you to specify that the resource assignment can be satisfied by any one of a number of individual resources belonging to a specified "resource pool."

- **Skills** that enable you to assign a skill rather than a specific resource.

Alternate resources can be defined for each assignment. The other two features are attributes of a particular resource. Thus, alternate resources can be used in combination with the other two features, which are mutually exclusive.

Also associated with the issue of resource substitution is the ability to roll up resources to a higher level in the resource hierarchy. You can use this feature to schedule resources at the pool level, whether you have defined the assignments at that level or at a lower level.

# Processes

## Alternate Resources

To indicate that an alternate resource can be used to satisfy a particular assignment, enter the name of the alternate resource when you define the assignment. During scheduling, Open Plan will initially try to use the originally requested resource. If this is impossible without either delaying the activity beyond its late date or overloading the resource, Open Plan will then try using the alternate instead. Open Plan will not use both resources in combination to satisfy the requirement. In attempting to schedule using the requested resource, Open Plan will, if necessary, try to split, stretch, or reprofile the resource as may be permitted for that activity before resorting to the alternate.

For example, suppose that an activity requires resource JOHN for 10 days, with an alternate, MARY. Open Plan will use JOHN if it can do so without delaying the project or overloading that resource. It may then decide to use MARY instead, but it will not, for example, use JOHN for the first 5 days and MARY for the last 5 days.

If it is not possible to schedule the activity using the requested resource without delaying the project or overloading the resource, Open Plan attempts to use the alternate resource instead. It is possible to set an option on the Advanced tab of the Resource Scheduling dialog box in which Open Plan will always attempt to use the alternate resource where the use of the original resource will delay the activity beyond its earliest feasible date.

It is not possible to specify more than one explicit alternate resource for any one assignment. If multiple assignments request the same resource and if two or more of these assignments refer to different alternate resources, the second and subsequent alternate resources encountered are ignored. Multiple alternates can, however, be specified if they constitute the members of a pool, as described in the next section.

## Resource Pools

It is possible to define a hierarchical set of resources in which certain resource codes are defined as the children of other resource codes. The parent/child relationship is implied by the resource code so that, for example, the resource PROGRAMMERS might have children PROGRAMMERS.JOHN, PROGRAMMERS.MARY, and so on.

A resource pool normally groups together similar resources, which can be regarded as interchangeable to some extent. Resource pools have no availabilities directly assigned to them; availabilities are specified only at the lowest level in the hierarchy, which represents individual resources.

It is possible to assign a resource pool to an activity, either as the requested resource or as the alternate. When a pool is encountered in an assignment, Open Plan attempts to satisfy the requirement using one of the individual resources in the pool. It tries them in an arbitrary order (actually, the order in which they appear in the resource window) in just the same way as alternate resources, using the first one that enables it to schedule the activity without overloading the resource or delaying the project completion. If this approach fails, Open Plan attempts to determine the resource that causes the least delay or least amount of overload and schedules the activity using that resource.

Open Plan can also consider members of a pool as separate resources during resource scheduling. In this case, Open Plan treats assignments separately rather than combining them. In order for Open Plan to separate the resources, the option on the Advanced tab of the Activity Details dialog box must be checked. If this option is not selected, Open Plan will combine the assignments and attempt to schedule a single resource.

> **Note:** In the time-limited resource scheduling mode, the use of alternate resources has no effect when the resource is overloaded unless you select the smoothing option.

It is possible to use pools in conjunction with alternate resources. As a result, it is possible to specify a particular resource as the requested resource and a pool as the alternate. For example, if you would like the programmer MARY to do the work if possible, but otherwise would accept anyone else from the PROGRAMMERS pool, you would specify PROGRAMMERS.MARY as the requested resource and PROGRAMMERS as the alternate.

## Skills

A skill is an attribute of an individual resource, each of which may have any number of skills. In general, the skill sets of different individual resources will be different but overlapping. Open Plan allows you to designate a skill as a requested resource, and this request may be satisfied by using any individual resource that possesses that skill. As with assignments involving pools, Open Plan considers each such resource with the requested skill until it finds one that can satisfy the requirement without overloading the resource or delaying the project. If this is impossible, Open Plan reverts to the resource that causes the least delay or least amount of overload.

The difference between skills and pools derives from the overlapping nature of the skill sets. A resource that possesses skills can also belong to a pool. For example, the resource PROGRAMMERS.MARY could be used to satisfy requests for PROGRAMMERS.MARY, or for PROGRAMMERS or for any of the skills MARY possesses.

As with pools, it is possible to combine skills with alternate resources, and in particular to specify a particular resource in combination with the skill required. For example, if you need a SQL programmer (someone with the skill SQL) but would choose Mary for preference, you can specify PROGRAMMERS.MARY as the requested resource, and SQL as the alternate.

## Resource Roll-up

Resource roll-up is an attribute that can be applied to individual resources or pools. If a resource is rolled up to a higher level, any request for it is treated as if the request is for its parent. The availability of that pool resource is the sum of all the rolled-up resources belonging to it.

The purpose of resource roll-up is to allow a more generic resource schedule to be produced, without detailed consideration of which individual resource will do each job. For example, if the pool PROGRAMMERS contains 12 individuals, the pool will be scheduled just as if PROGRAMMERS was an individual resource with an availability level of 12.

Although it is permitted for a pool to contain resources of different types (consumable and non-consumable resources, for example), this approach would not normally make much sense. In the case of a roll-up, mixing different resource types is not allowed. If an attempt is made to roll up resources of different types to the same pool, a fatal error occurs during resource scheduling.

As currently implemented, roll-up scheduling does not work in conjunction with alternates or skills. The existence of a rolled-up resource disables these features.

> **Note:** You can exercise some control over the order in which Open Plan considers members of a pool by rearranging the members of the pool when displaying the resource file. (Resources appearing on the left or above are considered first.)

> **Warning:** You must check all members of a resource pool for resource roll-up. If not, you will get a warning message, and your results will be incorrect.

## The Effect of Reservations on Resource Scheduling

Resource scheduling will not include resource availability reserved for another project. When scheduling using time limited mode, or resource limited mode with a threshold, a resource, which is totally reserved for another project during a particular period, might still be used if necessary, but not if the Hard Zero option is set.

When an activity belongs to an external subproject, the availability considered for scheduling that particular activity includes that reserved for the subproject, any higher level external subprojects to which it belongs, and the main project.

## Resource Usage by Other Projects

### Project Scheduling Priority

Summary resource usage allows different projects to be scheduled successively using only a single resource file. In order to realize the functionality of summary resource usage, it is necessary to define a priority for each project.

### Storing Resource Usage Summary

In order to take advantage of the resource usage summary, the resources used by a project must be saved in summary form with the resource file. This makes the data available to other projects using the same resource file. Each time the project is saved, the resource usage summary is also saved, provided that the appropriate selections have been made on the Scheduling tab of the Project Properties dialog box.

Storing the resource usage summary when you Save is only possible when both the project and the resource file are opened in exclusive mode.

### Using the Resource Usage Summary

When resource scheduling a project, on the Resource Scheduling dialog box there is an option to Consider Usage On Other Projects that have a higher-level priority. (A higher priority is indicated by a lower numeric value.)

A project has no access to the other projects directly. The priority Open Plan uses for a subsequent project is the priority at the time the summary usage data was last stored.

A resource is not double-counted if it is used by the project to which it was reserved and is not available to the current project. For example, suppose that 75% of a resource is reserved for a particular project, then this leaves 25% not reserved available for the current project.

- If the project uses only 60% of the resource instead of 75%, there is still only 25% available for the current project. (Open Plan does not recognize the difference between what was used and what was reserved if the usage is lower than quantity reserved.)

- If, on the other hand, the project uses 80% of the resource, the difference between what is used and what is reserved is subtracted from the 25% not reserved. This leaves only 20% available for the current project.

When scheduling a number of projects together (using external subprojects), the scheduling priority is that for the master project. (Of course, this does not prevent you from using the individual project priorities as one of the priority fields used to break ties between individual activities.)

> **Note:** It is essential that the summary resource usage data for higher priority projects be re-saved after any changes are made to the reservations.

### Maintaining Summary Resource Usage Data

Summary resource usage data needs to be deleted when it is no longer appropriate. There are two ways to delete these records:

- Perhaps the easiest way to delete the data is to use the Delete Summary Usage For This Project button on the Scheduling tab of the Project Properties dialog box. This will delete the records not only for the current project but also for any open external subprojects.

- The second way to delete the summary usage file is by selecting Summary Usage from the Edit tab on the Resource View. This will allow summary resource usage to be deleted for one or more projects selected from the list box.

## The Interpretation of Resource Scheduling Results

The main result of a resource schedule is the calculation of schedule dates for each activity. Sometimes, it may not be easy to understand how a particular set of dates has been determined, and Open Plan provides a set of diagnostic tools to assist in this. These tools include:

- The earliest feasible date
- The delaying resource
- The resource scheduling session log

### The Earliest Feasible Date

The earliest feasible date of an activity represents the earliest date on which the scheduling system was able to consider scheduling the activity. It might be the same as the early start date (it should never be earlier), or it might be later due to delays in previous activities.

If an activity has been delayed due to one or more previous activities having been delayed, the earliest feasible date will be later than the early start date. If the activity in question is delayed due to the unavailability of any of the resources it needs, the scheduled start date will be later than the earliest feasible start date. These two simple tests, therefore, establish whether an activity was delayed due to constraints on its own resources or due to previous delays:

- If the earliest feasible date is later than the early start date, there was a delay due to previous activities.
- If the scheduled start date is later than the earliest feasible date, there was a delay due to the resource assignments of that activity.

Of course, it is possible for both kinds of delay to apply to a single activity.

In addition to a delay in the start date, there can be a further delay in the finish date due to the use of splitting, stretching, or reprofiling. This is indicated by the scheduled duration being larger than the computed remaining duration.

### The Delaying Resource

It is also quite useful to know which resource caused an activity to be delayed and/or split. Open Plan attempts to indicate the delaying resource for an activity; although, it is only a partial answer because there may be several resources involved and Open Plan indicates only one of them. Any activity that has been delayed or split due to its own resource assignments should have a delaying resource indicated.

When there are alternate resources involved (including both pools and skills), the Delaying Resource field reports the first alternate resource tried, even though Open Plan may use a different alternate.

### The Resource Scheduling Session Log

Information can also be gleaned from the resource scheduling session log, which stores the messages issued by Open Plan during scheduling. This log contains a record of the decisions that Open Plan made with respect to the scheduling of each activity. The session log is interesting because it appears in the order in which the decisions were made and because it details each decision made with respect to an activity.

There are a number of diagnostic messages that may appear in the session log:

- Delaying activity `<activity>` due to resource `<resource>`
- Splitting activity `<activity>` due to resource `<resource>`
- Stretching activity `<activity>` due to resource `<resource>`
- Reprofiling activity `<activity>` due to resource `<resource>`
- Activity `<activity>` exceeds resource `<resource>` by `<amount>`
- Resource `<resource>` unlimited beyond availability
- Alternate `<resource>` unsuccessful â returning to `<resource>`
- Alternate `<resource>` unsuccessful â alternating to `<resource>`

The first four of these messages simply indicate that the specified activity has been delayed or somehow modified due to lack of availability of the specified resource.

The fifth message indicates that the specified activity could not be scheduled without exceeding the stated resource. This message appears only with time-limited scheduling or with resource-limited scheduling with thresholds. If the smoothing option is in effect, the message appears for every activity that exceeds a resource availability. If this option is not in effect, the message appears only when the amount that the resource is exceeded is greater than any previously incurred for that resource.

The sixth message is more of a warning that the system has had to schedule beyond the time horizon specified in the availability file, where the resource is considered to be unlimited. This may constitute an error on the part of the user, or it may have been deliberate. This message appears only once for each resource affected and is not related to a particular activity.

The final two messages in the list refer to situations in which Open Plan is unable to schedule an alternate resource. In the first case, Open Plan is returning to the originally requested resource. In the second case, Open Plan is continuing to the next alternate available from the requested pool or skill.

## Risk Analysis Calculations

Management decisions are concerned with the future. While we hope to influence the outcome of events by the decisions we make, everything about the future is, to a greater or lesser extent, uncertain. The techniques of risk analysis were developed to provide a consistent methodology for quantifying this uncertainty with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of decisions.

Nowhere is the need for this type of approach more evident than in project management. By definition, project management involves the planning and coordination of large numbers of activities for which there are often no precise precedents. In many cases, the data defining the durations and costs of the individual activities making up the project cannot be known exactly before the project begins. Clearly a project plan is, by its very nature, a forecast and thus contains elements of uncertainty.

Using the tools of modern risk analysis, Open Plan allows you to quantify the uncertainties associated with project schedules. By precisely defining the probable range of the durations of each activity, Open Plan provides you with the means to model the impact of these uncertainties on such critical areas as the project completion date.

The risk analysis feature in Open Plan provides one of the most sophisticated project management systems available today. This section is designed to introduce you to some of the concepts behind this powerful feature. It begins with a general discussion of the concept of probability, followed by a discussion of the following topics:

- Interpreting risk analysis data
- The operating characteristics of risk analysis in Open Plan
- The beta distribution, as used in Open Plan

> **Attention:** For a discussion of risk analysis operations in Open Plan, see Project Analysis Â» Risk Analysis in the Open Plan online help.

### The Concept of Probability

On the surface, the goal of risk analysis seems impossible. After all, how can something as elusive as uncertainty be quantified and measured? To tackle this problem, mathematicians developed the concept of probability. In this context, the term probability abandons its everyday meaning of a simple likelihood or chance and takes on a mathematical precision.

Perhaps the simplest introduction to the concept of mathematical probability is to consider the tossing of a coin. Most people are familiar with the idea that the probability (or "odds") of the outcome of a single toss of a coin producing a head is 50%. This estimate is based on the fact that there are just two possible outcomes to the process of tossing a coin (it is traditional to ignore the possibility of the coin landing on its edge) and that these two outcomes are equally likely.

The concept of mathematical probability asserts that if the coin tossing is repeated frequently, there should be a roughly equal number of outcomes for either side of the coin. The more often the coin is tossed, the better the chances that the proportion of heads to total coin tosses will approach 50%. In short, we can define the probability of a particular outcome occurring as equal to the number of ways of getting that outcome divided by the total number of possible outcomes of a given random process.

This notion that a definite and quantifiable relationship exists between the number of possible outcomes and the likelihood of any single outcome occurring lies at the heart of the concept of probability.

### Probability Distributions

The concept of probability provides the means to analyze the possible outcomes of a given process. Specifically, probability is concerned with defining the frequency of each possible outcome in relation to the range and distribution of all possible outcomes. The range and distribution of all possible outcomes for a process is referred to as the probability distribution of that process. This distribution can be represented in a number of ways, including tables and graphs.

To take a simple example, consider the roll of a single die as a process. Each possible outcome â 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 â is equally likely. As a result, we can say that each outcome has one chance in six of occurring. Another way of saying this is that each result has a probability of .167, and that when added together, all the possible outcomes have a probability of 1.0.

If we construct a table to represent all the possible outcomes and their probabilities, we come up with the following:

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | 0.167       |
| 2       | 0.167       |
| 3       | 0.167       |
| 4       | 0.167       |
| 5       | 0.167       |
| 6       | 0.167       |

We can also chart this distribution of probability using x and y coordinates where x represents the range of outcomes and y represents the probability of each outcome.

Because the probabilities for all the possible outcomes are the same in this case, this type of distribution is called a uniform distribution.

Of course, not all probability distributions are uniform. Consider, for example, the combined score from rolling a pair of dice. The range of possible outcomes is from two to twelve. Yet as any gambler knows, these outcomes are not equally likely. Rolling a twelve is much less likely than rolling a seven because there are many ways of achieving a seven but only one way to roll a twelve.

If we represent this distribution as a table we get the following:

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| 2       | 0.028       |
| 3       | 0.056       |
| 4       | 0.085       |
| 5       | 0.111       |
| 6       | 0.139       |
| 7       | 0.167       |
| 8       | 0.139       |
| 9       | 0.111       |
| 10      | 0.085       |
| 11      | 0.056       |
| 12      | 0.028       |

Representing these probabilities as a graph makes it clear why this type of distribution is referred to as a triangular distribution.

Since the height of the triangle above at any point along the x-axis represents the probability of the outcome represented by that point, the illustration makes it clear that the probability of rolling a seven is much higher than the probability of any other outcome.

Consider also the symmetry of the shape of the triangle. No matter which direction one moves away from the triangle's apex, the probability of occurrence declines at the same rate.

All triangular distributions are not necessarily symmetrical. Later in this section, we discuss the example of a triangular distribution where the most probable outcome is heavily weighted or skewed towards one end of the distribution.

Obviously, rolling a pair of dice adds complexity to the possible outcomes of the process when compared to rolling a single die. But suppose we add more and more dice, creating more and more possible outcomes. Eventually, if we reach a level of sufficient complexity, the probability distribution looks something like a normal distribution.

The normal distribution is an example of a continuous distribution. Unlike our earlier examples in which each possible outcome was discrete, the curved shape of the normal distribution now depicts a range of continuous rather than discrete outcomes. As a result, it is the area under the curve between any two x values that represents the probability of the outcome falling between these two values. (Incidentally, both uniform and triangular distributions can also represent continuous outcome.)

As useful as the normal distribution is, it still cannot represent situations where, for one reason or another, a particular outcome is more probable than others and yet does not fall in the exact center of the range of all possible outcomes. In this situation, some type of asymmetrical probability distribution is called for.

Let us re-examine the process of rolling two dice but this time analyze the probability distribution of the greater of the two numbers that appears. Clearly, the greater of two values is more likely to be toward the top end of the range of each â in fact, six turns out to be the most likely value. Why? Because out of 36 possible outcomes, only one will result in the maximum number being one (that is, both dice would have to be one), while there are a total of eleven ways to get six as the maximum:

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | 0.028       |
| 2       | 0.083       |
| 3       | 0.139       |
| 4       | 0.194       |
| 5       | 0.250       |

This is an example of an asymmetrical or skewed distribution and can be represented as a triangular shape.

As a process increases in complexity, we eventually come up with a continuous curved shape for the distribution, somewhat similar to a normal distribution but skewed in one direction.

Depending on how the distribution is defined, there are a number of ways of representing this type of probability. However, for the purposes of Risk Analysis, a family of distributions known as beta distributions is used.

The beta distribution, like the triangular distribution, is primarily used to describe asymmetrical probability. However, a beta distribution differs from a triangular distribution since its shape effectively precludes outcomes at the extremes of the distribution from having any significant probability. By contrast, a triangular distribution allows for a significant probability for outcomes at the extreme limits of the range, no matter how much the distribution is skewed.

> **Note:** It is generally recommended that asymmetrical probability be represented by triangular rather than beta distributions in Open Plan.

### Cumulative Distributions

While representations of distributions that focus on the frequencies of possible outcomes are very common, there are other approaches as well. Another way to represent a probability distribution is to use a cumulative distribution of probabilities. The result is an s-shaped curve representing for each x value the probability that the outcome is less than or equal to that value. The cumulative curve always starts at 0 and ends at 1.

### Summarizing Probability Distributions

Representing a probability distribution as a table or graphically on an x/y axis tells us everything we need to know about a process whose outcomes can be described theoretically. But, this is not always possible in the real world. Consider the problem of representing data arrived at empirically, for example, by sampling the outcomes of an experiment.

For this and other reasons, it is often convenient to use some statistical representation or summary to describe a sampled distribution. The most common of these summary statistics are:

- The mean value of the distribution
- The standard deviation of the distribution

The mean value (traditionally represented by the symbol Âµ) is a measure of the central tendency of the distribution and is more or less synonymous with the more colloquial terms average and expected value. The mean is calculated as follows:

```
Âµ = (xâ + xâ + ... + xâ) / n
```

where Âµ is the mean, xâ, xâ, and xâ are outcomes, and n is the total number of outcomes.

For probability distributions based on sampling, the mean is considered to be the most reliable statistical indicator of the central tendency since it takes into account all the outcomes sampled.

The other important statistical measure of a distribution is the standard deviation (represented by the symbol Ï). The standard deviation measures the amount of variation within the distribution around the mean value and is calculated by first estimating the variance of the distribution according to the following formula:

```
Ï = â[(xâ - xÌ)Â² + (xâ - xÌ)Â² + ... + (xâ - xÌ)Â²] / n
```

where xâ, xâ, and xâ are outcomes, xÌ is the sampled mean value, and n is the total number of outcomes.

The square root of the variance is then taken to find the standard deviation for the distribution.

For example, assume that ten students taking a math test receive the following scores: 64, 69, 71, 73, 73, 75, 82, 82, 82, 89.

The mean score is 76:
```
(64 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 73 + 75 + 82 + 82 + 82 + 89) / 10 = 76
```

The variance is 54.1:
```
(144 + 49 + 25 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 169) / 10 = 54.1
```

The standard deviation is 7.1:
```
â54.1 = 7.1
```

As it turns out, if we know the mean and the standard deviation, we can completely describe a normal distribution represented by the equation:

```
f(x) = (1 / (Ïâ2Ï)) * e^(-Â½((x-Âµ)/Ï)Â²)
```

where f is the frequency, x is the outcome, Âµ is the mean value, and Ï is the standard deviation.

Note that the value of f peaks when x = Âµ and declines symmetrically as x moves away from Âµ in either direction. The rate at which f declines depends on the parameter Ï. Note also, that the value of f never quite reaches zero. This means that no value of x is an absolutely impossible outcome for any true normal distribution. In practical work, however, it is common practice to truncate the tails of a normal distribution.

Also, note that since not all distributions are symmetrical, there may also be a need to measure the extent to which variations from the mean in one direction are more likely than the other in order to describe the distribution mathematically.

### Other Measures of Central Tendency

Although the mean is perhaps the most common measure of central tendency of a distribution by virtue of its stability, it is not the only one. Other measures of central tendency can also be useful, particularly in cases of asymmetrical distributions. Two of the most common of these are:

- The mode value
- The median value

The mode or "most likely" value of a distribution is represented by the highest point on the frequency distribution curve.

The median value of a distribution divides the area under the curve into two equal parts.

For example, assume once again that ten students taking a math test receive the following scores: 64, 69, 71, 73, 73, 75, 82, 82, 82, 89.

In this case, the mode score is 82 (the most common score), while the median score is 74 (five students scored below, five students scored above).

For symmetrical probability distributions, the mean, mode, and median values are the same.

### More About Standard Deviation

As we have seen, the standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squares of the individual deviations from the mean value. For this reason, the standard deviation is sometimes referred to as the root mean square (RMS) deviation. It should be noted that one result of this squaring is that the standard deviation measures the degree of variation without regard for the direction in which the variation occurs.

Still, the standard deviation of a probability distribution is a very useful value to know. As a very rough guide, it turns out that there is about a two-thirds chance of any particular outcome falling within one standard deviation of the mean value and about a 99% chance of the outcome falling within three standard deviations of the mean. This variation can occur in either direction from the mean and is usually referred to as a 99% confidence interval.

For example, the mean temperature for Houston, Texas, during the month of August at 5 P.M. is 93 with a standard deviation of 3.5. Based on three standard deviations (that is, Â±10.5), then it is almost (99%) certain, that the 5 P.M. temperature in Houston on any given day in August will fall between 82.5 and 103.5.

### Confidence Intervals

As noted previously, the standard deviation measures the degree of variation without regard for the direction. This is not a problem in symmetrical distributions, but if the distribution is not symmetrical then there may be a significantly greater chance of a variation in one direction rather than the other.

Another way of establishing confidence for a probability distribution is to estimate confidence intervals directly, using statistical sampling. Establishing a confidence interval directly means determining a pair of values within which we have some confidence that the outcome will fall. The interval needs to be qualified by the degree of confidence required âa 90% confidence interval would be a pair of values between which the outcome in question has a 90% chance of falling. Thus, for example, in the random selection of any number between 1 and 100, there is a 90% confidence interval that the number chosen will be greater than 5 and less than 96.

It is normally implicit that the interval should be symmetrical, in the sense that there would be an equal probability that the outcome would fall outside the confidence interval in either direction. Note that because the distribution itself may be skewed, this means that the confidence interval is not in general symmetrically placed with respect to the mean value.

In general, confidence intervals calculated in this manner are to be preferred to those based on standard deviations since the skew in the underlying distribution is indicated.

In some cases, however, standard deviations are more reliable indicators of confidence. This is particularly true for relatively small samples since standard deviations are based on all outcomes instead of a few extreme values.

### Combining Probabilities

So far we have just considered the probability in relation to a single process. Yet project management poses the case where many activities, each with separate factors affecting duration and cost, can nevertheless affect each other as well.

Fortunately, the probability theory provides us with the analytical tools to combine probability distributions in ways appropriate to specific circumstances. For example, consider the following project consisting of a pair of activities:

[A] â [B]

Suppose that activity A and activity B are both expected to have a duration between one and six days, and that any number of days between one and six is equally likely.

The mean or "expected" duration of each activity is 3.5 days:
```
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6
```

Further, we can calculate that the mean duration for the whole project is seven days by adding the mean durations of the individual activities together. Mean durations are additive in this case.

It also turns out that variances are additive in this case. The variance of the distribution of each duration is approximately 2.9, and so the variance of the total project is 5.8. By taking the square root of the total project variance, we arrive at the standard deviation, about 2.4 in this case.

It is common shorthand to state this estimate of the overall project duration as "7 Â± 2.4." Note that this does not mean that the duration is sure to fall within these limits. (For a normal distribution, the probability of an outcome falling within 1 standard deviation of the mean is only about 68%.)

What is the actual shape of the distribution of the overall project duration in this case? If we graph the duration probability of the project, we realize we have the same triangular distribution shape we get when we roll a pair of dice and add the two numbers.

Unfortunately, we cannot always combine probabilities by adding means and variances. In fact it is only appropriate to do so when the outcomes themselves are being added, as in the case of the durations of two activities to be performed in series.

Suppose that the same two activities had to be done in parallel. The overall project completion is now dependent on both activities being completed. In other words, we are looking for the distribution of the greater of two uniformly distributed durations. This is analogous to the problem discussed earlier of finding the distribution of the greater of a pair of randomly thrown dice.

Since project networks generally comprise a multitude of activities in combinations of the above two configurations (that is, partly in series and partly in parallel), the analytical approach to calculating probability introduced here quickly becomes impractical. The only practical approach is to use a technique known as Monte Carlo simulation.

### The Monte Carlo Simulation Technique

The Monte Carlo simulation technique gets its name from the casinos that make that European city famous. Conceptually, Monte Carlo simulation is very simple. In order to find out the distribution of possible outcomes, we merely perform the process a large number of times. With the results, we build up a histogram to represent the probability distribution from the individual outcomes of each trial.

Of course, we cannot really perform a project many times. Indeed, we cannot even perform it once without defeating a principal purpose of risk analysis (namely, to decide whether or not the project is feasible in the first place).

We can, however, pretend to do so, and this is exactly what Monte Carlo simulation does. Instead of doing time analysis once based on fixed duration lengths for each activity, we simulate the project several hundred or several thousand times. Each time, we use a different set of data for durations and costs sampled from the probability distributions of these uncertain values.

The sampling is done so that the probability of selecting a particular duration in the simulation is the same as our subjective estimate of the probability of that value actually occurring. With definite values for activity duration and costs thus supplied, we can calculate such things as project completion date and total cost for each trial.

As enough simulations are performed, a definite picture of the risks inherent in the project begins to emerge.

> **Note:** Do Monte Carlo simulations work? If you have a pair of dice, you can try simulating the simple two-activity project described in the previous section. Each simulation of the project is conducted by rolling the two dice, the total project duration for that trial being the sum of the values thrown. Keep a note of the number of times each possible value (from two to twelve) occurs. After a while, the expected triangular distribution should emerge, and the more simulations you do the better the results.

### The Question of Subjectivity

Estimates of probability are always subjective to some degree. Consider your estimate of the outcome of the next toss of a coin which has just turned up heads 20 times in succession. If we assume that the coin is unbiased, it follows by definition that the next toss is just as likely to be heads as tails. But some people might start to question this assumption after 20 consecutive heads.

How soon and to what extent this consideration is allowed to modify your estimate of the probability of the next outcome depends upon such factors as how well you trusts the coin-thrower, whether you have examined the coin, etc. In this way, a subjective viewpoint would play a definite role in the expectation of probability.

In fact, all probabilities are to some extent subjective. That is to say, they reflect the state of knowledge of the estimator.

In project management, the subjective knowledge of the project planners plays an important role in estimating uncertainties. Unlike the simple example of coin tossing, it is not usually possible to perform experiments about the outcome of processes of interest to project managers. Nor do these events lend themselves to the calculation of a probability based on arguments of symmetry. Generally, we are concerned with quantifying the uncertainty associated with a forecast of the cost or duration of a process which (a) has yet to occur and (b) is expected to occur exactly once.

Clearly, no two individuals are likely to agree on these definitions nor is there any way to prove who was right even after the process. Whether tossing a single coin or analyzing the risks of a project combining thousands of activities, the estimate of the uncertainty is, in the end, a statement more about the state of knowledge of the estimator than about the real world.

The concept of probability and risk analysis in this environment is not easy to grasp. Indeed, some project managers may feel that it is without foundation. We will, nevertheless, maintain that it is possible to make a subjective estimate of the probability distribution associated with our forecasts about the future. Perhaps more importantly, it is necessary to make such an estimate since the failure to do so merely asserts that there is no uncertainty associated with these forecasts.

## Interpreting Risk Analysis Data

The standard views supplied with Open Plan enable you to quickly access important information about projects you wish to subject to risk analysis. However, since the results produced by risk analysis can be more complex than those produced by time analysis or resource scheduling, you may require more detailed information about how Open Plan handles certain reporting functions. Among the basic concepts of reporting risk analysis results covered in this section are:

- The significance of early and late start dates
- The concept of sampling error
- The calculation of finish dates

### Early and Late Start Dates

For the most part, risk analysis is concerned with the earliest dates possible for activities in general and for the project completion in particular. On large projects, it may also be important to track the probable early start dates for multiple project milestones.

In general, the early start dates calculated by risk analysis will be later than those in a project using standard time analysis. This is because in simulating a project with parallel paths of activities, it is always the latest of the early start dates that controls the scheduling of the remainder of the project.

This tendency of the latest early dates controlling the subsequent early dates also tends to skew the shape of the probability distribution of all early start dates to the right. This skewedness undercuts the reliability of using the calculated mean date and standard deviation to estimate confidence intervals. In many cases, for example, it may turn out that adding three standard deviations to the right of the mean early start date results in a value outside the range of the curve, thus rendering confidence levels based on standard deviations inaccurate.

Unlike early start dates, the latest start dates of activities may be of little practical significance to many users. Nevertheless, some project managers may be concerned with late start dates and use this information to avoid starting expensive activities with lots of float much earlier than absolutely necessary by assigning that activity a target start date. Assuming that you wish these target start dates to pose a minimal risk for delaying the project completion date, you would want to select a date at a very low confidence level (for example, 1% to 5%). Selecting a later start date (in other words, a date with a higher probability of actually occurring) increases the likelihood of causing further delays in the completion of the project.

> **Note:** An inevitable result of supplying an effective target start date to an activity is the alteration of the early date's distribution curve and an increase in the probability of the activity being critical and thus affecting subsequent activities. Specifying a date with a very low probability to a small number of activities is likely to have a minimal effect on the project. However, the more activities supplied with target start dates, the greater the likelihood that the final outcome of the project will be altered from the original projections.

### The Concept of Sampling Error

One key to interpreting risk analysis data is understanding the significance of the values reported for the mean and standard deviation of a probability distribution. It is important to keep in mind that these values, based on the sampling of Monte Carlo simulations, are estimates. Obviously, the more simulations Open Plan performs, the more likely the estimated mean and standard deviation would approach the theoretically correct values for that distribution.

However, it turns out that the likely error in the estimate of a mean can itself be estimated. To estimate the sampling error of a mean value arrived at by multiple simulations, it is necessary only to divide the standard deviation by the square root of the number of simulations performed to calculate the standard error of the mean. Just as one standard deviation on either side of a mean defines a 68% probability of occurrence of an outcome within that range, one standard error on either side of the mean defines a 68% probability that the theoretical value of the mean will fall in this range. Similar confidence levels of 95% based on two standard errors and 99% based on three standard errors can also be calculated in this way.

For example, assume that the probability distribution of the early start date of an activity has a standard deviation of three days. At the 99% confidence level, the sampling error of our estimated mean is as follows:

| Number of Simulations | Estimated Sampling Error (99% Confidence) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 10                   | Â± 3 days                                   |
| 100                  | Â± 0.9 days                                 |
| 1000                 | Â± 0.3 days                                 |

The capability to estimate a sampling error is one reason why it is important to display standard deviations alongside mean values when reporting on the results of risk analysis.

### Finish Dates

Open Plan does not generate the mean and standard deviation of the finish dates for each activity directly during the risk analysis. Instead, these dates are calculated analytically, using the sampled mean and standard deviation of the start dates and the theoretical mean and standard deviation of the specified duration distribution.

Finish dates are calculated in this manner to save both space and processing time. An unintended result, however, is the possibility of slight inconsistencies between the results reported for the finish of one activity and the start of its successor. These differences are not significant relative to the sampling error implicit in the Monte Carlo approach and should disappear if a large enough number of simulations are performed.

## Operating Characteristics of Risk Analysis

This section contains detailed information on the following areas of the operation of risk analysis in Open Plan:

- Sampling methods
- A comparison of symmetrical distributions used by Open Plan
- A comparison of asymmetrical distributions used by Open Plan
- Analytical calculations in risk analysis

### Sampling Methods in Risk Analysis

All sampling performed by Open Plan is based on pseudo-random numbers generated in the range 0 to 32767.

Uniform and triangular distributions are sampled by the inversion method. In the case of uniform distributions, this method amounts to a simple linear transformation of the random number to place it in the range specified by the user.

Open Plan samples normal distributions by adding 12 independent pseudo-random numbers. The input minimum and maximum values specifying the distribution are taken to represent a range of six standard deviations while the mean is calculated by averaging the two values.

This method of sampling is approximate since Open Plan deliberately ignores the approximately 1% chance of data falling outside of that range in a true normal distribution. However, the accuracy of this approximation can be gauged from the following comparison of theoretical and sampled percentile points for a normal distribution ranging from 0 to 100:

| Percentile Point | Theoretical Value | Sample Value Based on 10,000 Simulations |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1                | 11                | 12                                        |
| 5                | 23                | 23                                        |
| 10               | 29                | 29                                        |
| 25               | 39                | 39                                        |
| 50               | 50                | 50                                        |
| 75               | 61                | 61                                        |
| 90               | 71                | 72                                        |
| 95               | 77                | 78                                        |
| 99               | 89                | 89                                        |

For example, in this case the theoretical expectation that 5% of the outcomes will not be greater than 23 is exactly mirrored by the sampled values.

> **Attention:** For information about sampling a beta distribution, see The Beta Distribution.

In all four cases, the underlying distribution is taken to represent a continuous outcome. In reality, however, the actual durations and costs are measured in discrete units such as days, dollars, etc. To translate continuous values to discrete values, the two specified end-points are treated inclusively and given full weight. For example, the user has specified a particular range of possible outcomes as from 0 to 10. This indicates that a total of 11 possible outcomes exist, and (in the case of uniform distributions) the values 0 and 10 are just as likely to occur as any intervening values.

This translation of continuous to discrete values involves the possibility of rounding errors in cases where the number of possible outcomes is relatively small. These errors may affect the standard deviation of the distribution.

### Comparing Symmetrical Distributions

All four distributions used by risk analysis in Open Plan can be directly compared only in the case when the triangular and beta distributions are specified to be symmetrical. In the following table, each distribution was assumed to have a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 100, and a mean value of 50:

| Percentile Point | Uniform (SD=29.2) | Triangular (SD=20.6) | Normal (SD=16.8) | Beta (SD=16.8) |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1                | 1                 | 6                    | 11               | 14             |
| 5                | 5                 | 15                   | 23               | 22             |
| 10               | 10                | 22                   | 29               | 27             |
| 25               | 25                | 35                   | 39               | 37             |
| 50               | 50                | 50                   | 50               | 50             |
| 75               | 75                | 65                   | 61               | 62             |
| 90               | 90                | 78                   | 71               | 72             |
| 95               | 95                | 84                   | 77               | 78             |
| 99               | 99                | 93                   | 89               | 86             |

The table shows the cumulative probability distribution for each of the four distribution types. The Percentile Point column indicates the height of this cumulative curve. Each of the subsequent columns shows the corresponding value for a particular distribution. For example, the second line of the table indicates that 5% of the values sampled from the normal distribution will be equal to or less than 23.

As might be expected, a uniform distribution represents a considerably wider spread of values than the others, indicated both by the standard deviation (SD) and by the extreme percentile points. The triangular distribution follows in terms of spread. The normal and beta distributions both have finer tails than either the uniform or triangular distributions and, in this symmetrical case, resemble each other quite closely.

### Comparing Asymmetrical Distributions

It is also possible to see how the two asymmetrical, or skewed, distributions behave when varying degrees of skew are introduced. One interesting point is that the standard deviation of the triangular distribution increases with skew. In a sense, this tendency of triangular distributions compensates for the skew by ensuring that there is still a significant probability of data falling throughout the range:

| Mode Value | Mean Value | Median Value | SD | Percentile Points |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------|------------|--------------|----|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|            |            |              |    | 1                  | 5   | 10  | 25  | 75  | 90  | 95  | 99  |
| 0          | 33         | 30           | 24 | 0                  | 2   | 4   | 13  | 50  | 68  | 78  | 90  |
| 5          | 35         | 31           | 23 | 2                  | 4   | 7   | 15  | 51  | 69  | 78  | 90  |
| 10         | 37         | 33           | 23 | 2                  | 6   | 9   | 17  | 52  | 70  | 79  | 90  |
| 15         | 38         | 35           | 22 | 3                  | 8   | 11  | 20  | 54  | 72  | 80  | 91  |

Note how both the mean and the median of the distribution are much closer to the central point (50) than is the mode. (In fact, calculating the mean of a triangular distribution is analogous to calculating the center of gravity of a triangle by adding the minimum, mode, and maximum values and dividing by three.)

Also, note that even with extreme skew in either direction, there remains a significant chance of obtaining data close to the opposite end of the range. For example, when the mode is equal to the maximum value of 100, there is a 1% chance of obtaining values below 10.

By contrast, the standard deviation of the beta distribution decreases with skew, exacerbating the tendency for a very long, thin tail to the distribution:

Both the mean and the median in a beta distribution are closer to the specified mode. As the amount of skew increases in either direction, the probability of values toward the opposite extreme becomes insignificant. Thus, when the mode in a beta distribution is equal to the maximum value of 100, there is only a 1% chance of obtaining data in the bottom half of the range. This particular beta distribution does not yield significantly different results from a triangular distribution with a minimum value of 50.

### Analytical Calculations in Risk Analysis

Since some results produced by risk analysis can be calculated analytically, Open Plan takes advantage of this fact to speed up processing and to minimize data storage requirements (thereby decreasing the need for disk access).

In particular, the mean and standard deviation of early and late finish dates for an activity are, in most circumstances, calculated from the mean and standard deviation of the early start dates, the late start dates, and the input duration distribution.

One result of this approach is that there may be minor discrepancies between the mean and standard deviation reported for a finish date of one activity and those of the corresponding start date of a successor activity. This is due to the sampled mean and standard deviation of the first activity's duration in the particular simulation run not being equal to their theoretical values. This discrepancy should not be significant unless the number of simulations is very small and can be reduced or even eliminated by increasing the number of simulations.

## The Beta Distribution

Strictly speaking, the beta distribution is a two-parameter distribution generating a random variable in the range {0,1}. In fact, this type of distribution originally arose out of the study of order statistics: if the two parameters are n and m, the distribution represents the probability distribution of the (n+1)th lowest value out of (m+1) independent random numbers. Note that this means that the values of n and m must be integers.

In order to make the beta distribution capable of representing data in a range other than {0,1}, as is certainly required for the purposes of risk analysis, a simple linear transformation is required. This, however, implies the specification of an additional two parameters to define the minimum and maximum of the distribution.

Thus, in order to have a sufficiently generalized beta distribution capable of representing an arbitrary range of data, a total of four parameters is required: two parameters to specify the range of data and two parameters (which must be integers) to define the shape of the distribution.

Typically, a user specifying a skewed distribution expects to specify only three parameters â the minimum, the maximum, and the mode. For the beta distribution, however, the position of the mode relative to the range is based on the ratio of the two integer parameters n and m. In effect, it is impossible to define a beta distribution with only the minimum, maximum, and mode without encountering the following problems:

- The position of the mode does not in itself uniquely define the shape of parameters n and m. A beta distribution where n equals 2 and m equals 3 is vastly different from one where n equals 200 and m equals 300. Although both distributions could share the same mode value, the latter distribution would be much more highly peaked, providing a greatly reduced probability of an occurrence at the extremes of the range.

- The position of the mode may not be represented by any rational fraction, so that no integer values of n and m exactly fit. Of course, one can get arbitrarily close by choosing a very large value for m. This approach, however, would result in a very peaked distribution.

- When the mode is close to either end of the range, the shape of the resulting distribution enables only an extremely small probability of realizing a value toward the opposite end of the range. (Just how small is shown in the table at the end of the previous section.)

These problems highlight the limitations of using a beta distribution as opposed to a triangular distribution for representing probabilities in project management. Nevertheless, some managers continue to favor the beta distribution since the curved shape would seem more "natural."

Open Plan attempts to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of beta distributions by fixing the value of parameter m at 6, making the standard deviation of the beta approximate to that of a normal distribution with the same range. This results in restricting the n parameter to an integer value between 0 and 6, and it is out of this limited group of possible beta distributions that Open Plan conducts its sampling. To overcome the rounding error resulting from this small number of discrete allowable values for n, linear interpolation is used between the two n values which bracket the required (generally fractional) value of the mode.

This approach has a number of ramifications. For example, as noted in the previous section, Open Plan uses the theoretical mean and standard deviations of the duration distributions in order to calculate certain results analytically whenever possible. However, Open Plan only approximates the theoretical values of beta distributions using the following empirically derived formulae:

The quality of these approximations is adequate for most purposes, as indicated in the following table, based on a series of beta distributions in the range 0 to 100, with various modes. The table compares the mean and standard deviations, as estimated by the above formulae, with sampling estimates based on 10,000 simulations:

## Cost Calculations

Costs calculations take place at all levels within a project and are among the most feature-rich aspects of Open Plan. Using cost calculations, you can calculate current values for both budget and actual costs, compare these values to baseline budget and actual costs, and calculate earned value.

- **Budgeted costs** â Open Plan allows you to enter and store time-phased budgets by any or all of the four categories.

- **Actual costs** â When entering resource progress, you can enter actual costs both as quantities of resource units and as costs. You can also enter actual cost directly against an activity if you do not track actuals back to the resource.

- **Baseline dates** â You can store either early, late, or scheduled dates for activities in a project baseline. You can create multiple baselines for a project to allow you to base earned value calculations on different stages of project development. You can also create a performance measurement baseline (PMB) that is used for cost calculations.

- **Physical percent complete** â When entering information about the progress of an activity, you can enter a separate estimate for the physical completion of the activity. Physical percent complete can also be entered for resources assigned to an activity.

In Open Plan, all costs come from the cost of the resources assigned to an activity in a project. This means that unless a project uses resources, you cannot use Open Plan to calculate or display costs.

### Cost Data

Cost calculations take place at all levels within a project. The following sections discuss the levels at which cost calculations are performed:

- Resource
- Activity
- Subproject
- Project

### Resource

The manner in which resources are assigned has ramifications for the way the resource cost is calculated. In Open Plan, resources can be assigned in either of the following two ways:

- **Total** â When resources are assigned using any of the available spread curves, Open Plan interprets the value as a specified total of resource units required by an activity regardless of the activity duration. Resources that are assigned in this way are multiplied by a unit rate to yield a cost.

- **Level** â When resources are assigned without using a spread curve, Open Plan interprets the value as a specified level of resource units required by the activity for each time unit. Resource units that are assigned in this way are multiplied by a duration before multiplying by a unit rate to yield a cost.

The duration used in this calculation can be either the resource duration (called a period) or the duration of the activity to which the resource is assigned. If it is entered, Open Plan uses the resource period instead of the activity duration.

Depending on how the resource is defined in the Resource Details dialog box, the rate used in calculating the resource cost can be either a flat rate or one that can escalate over time.

All values are expressed as currency and are separated into the four resource categories:

- Labor
- Material
- Other Direct Costs
- Subcontract

Each category is rolled up to fields in the activity table.

For Labor resources, Open Plan rolls up the budget, earned value, scheduled value, actual quantities, and remaining quantities to the activity and subproject levels of the project provided that:

- Budget is stored in the BAC_QTY field of the activity.
- Earned value is stored in the BCWP_QTY field of the activity.
- Scheduled value is stored in the BCWS_QTY field of the activity.
- Actual quantities are stored in the ACWP_QTY field of the activity.
- Remaining quantities are stored in the ETC_QTY field of the activity.

In the case of Other Direct Costs resources, Open Plan stores the budget values in the activity budget cost field of the activity. In addition, any actual costs for these resources are stored in the activity actual cost field of the activity.

For all resource classes, the resource definition table contains a field called the Roll Cost flag. The value of this field is set to True by default. If you change this value to False for a specific resource, Open Plan does not use that resource during cost calculations. To set the value to False, clear the Consider in Cost Calculations option on the General tab of the Resource Details dialog box for that resource.

> **Attention:** For more information on using the Resource Details dialog box, see Working with Resources Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Resource Details Dialog Box in the Open Plan online help.

### Activity

Open Plan stores the rolled-up values of the budget and actual cost of resources in the activities to which the resources are assigned.

# Processes

## Activity Fields

| Activity Fields | Budget Cost (BAC) | Earned Value (BCWP) | Scheduled Value (BCWS) | Actual Cost (ACWP) | Remaining Cost (EAC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Labor Quantity | BAC_QTY | BCWP_QTY | BCWS_QTY | ACWP_QTY | ETC_QTY |
| Labor Cost | BAC_LAB | BCWP_LAB | BCWS_LAB | ACWP_LAB | ETC_LAB |
| Material Cost | BAC_MAT | BCWP_MAT | BCWS_MAT | ACWP_MAT | ETC_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | BAC_ODC | BCWP_ODC | BCWS_ODC | ACWP_ODC | ETC_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | BAC_SUB | BCWP_SUB | BCWS_SUB | ACWP_SUB | ETC_SUB |

In addition, if a baseline is applied to the project, the cost calculations process can also calculate the budgeted cost of the work scheduled for each activity. Open Plan performs this calculation by looking at what baseline budget value should have been accomplished by the current Time Now date.

Open Plan uses the Project Measurement Baseline (PMB) for this calculation if it exists. If the PMB does not exist, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple baselines, the first selected baseline.

## Subproject

Subprojects may have their own resources assigned to them. Typically, resources that are assigned at the subproject level are those that work as long as the subproject takes. These are known as Level of Effort resources. The cost calculations that are performed at the subproject level are the same as those performed at the activity level.

In addition, the Include Child Activity Values in Subproject Costs option on the Cost Calculations dialog box has ramifications for cost calculations:

- If this option is selected, Open Plan rolls up budget and actual values from child activities to their parent subprojects.
- If this option is cleared, a subproject calculates budget values from its own resources but not from child activities.

If you report on a project using grouped views, you may wish to turn this feature off in order to avoid double counting the activity cost by including it in both the activity and its parent subproject.

The subproject physical percent complete (PPC) is calculated by summing the activity BCWP values of the activity and dividing by the summed baseline BAC cost fields for all categories:

```
Subproject PPC = Sum(BCWP_CST) / Sum(BAC_LAB + BAC_MAT + BAC_ODC + BAC_SUB)

Projects inherit their rolled up physical percent complete, budget costs, and actual costs from these values in their activities.

> **Attention:** For information on how each cost is calculated, see Cost Calculations.

## Resource Cost Table (CST) Records

CST calculations are done cumulatively. The new record represents the difference between the cum-to-date and the existing CST records. The following list details how CST table record values are calculated:

- **ACWP_QTY** â User entered or calculated through auto progress
- **ACWP_CST** â User entered or the individual record's ACWP_QTY multiplied by the unit rate
- **ACWP_ESC** â User entered or the spread of ACWP_QTY over the From Date to the To Date multiplied by the escalated rates
- **BCWP_QTY** â Take the sum of the resources used stored in the RES_USED field in the performance measurement baseline in the Baseline Usage table multiplied by the resource PPC and then subtract the values of the existing BCWP_QTY records
- **BCWP_CST** â Take the sum of the resource costs stored in the RES_CST field in the performance measurement baseline in the Baseline Usage table multiplied by the resource PPC and then subtract the values of the existing BCWP_CST records
- **BCWP_ESC** â Read the records in the performance measurement baseline in the Baseline Usage table in date order until reaching the cumulative BCWP_QTY. Add the escalated resources stored in the RES_ESC field in the performance measurement baseline for the records and ratio the last values as needed, and then subtract the existing values for BCWP_ESC records.

For example, assume that the cumulative BCWP_QTY = 4, and the resource has the following 3 PMB.BSU records:

| Quantity | RES_ESC Cost |
|---|---|
| 1 | $10 |
| 4 | $50 |
| 6 | $80 |

To calculate the BCWP_ESC, Open Plan reads the records in the performance measurement baseline in the Baseline Usage table in order until it reaches 4. This returns the first record and three-fourths of the second record. Open Plan then adds the RES_ESC values: 10 + Â¾(50). This gives you a BCWP_ESC of 37.5.

## Cost Calculations

This section discusses the cost calculations Open Plan uses to determine the BAC, BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, ETC, and EAC for a project.

### Budget at Completion

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the total number of labor resource units budgeted for the project. The Labor Quantity BAC for the project is stored in the BAC_QTY field in the Project table. The value stored in the project field is calculated at or rolled up from the activity level.

> **Note:** When ACWP is being calculated, the fields ACWP_CST and ACWP_ESC are set on the CST records based upon the current rates and escalations. These values are locked in. If ACWP_CST and ACWP_ESC are already non-zero (indicating that they have been calculated previously), the CST record is NOT recalculated.

The calculations that are performed at the activity level depend on whether the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method option is selected on the Cost tab of the Project Properties dialog box.

By default, the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method is cleared for new projects. In this mode, Open Plan calculates the Labor Quantity BAC by summing the values in the RES_USED field for labor resources assigned to this activity for the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) in the Baseline Usage table. By always using the PMB when it is available, Open Plan provides consistency and reliability.

If there is no baseline named PMB, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple selected baselines, the baseline identified as Baseline 1. If the project contains baselines, but none is selected or named PMB, Open Plan prompts you to select a baseline. If the project has no baselines, Open Plan uses the Version 2 Cost Calculation Method automatically.

If the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method is selected, Open Plan calculates this value by summing the values in the Level field of the Assignment table adjusted for any curve, offset, or period that may be defined.

#### Cost by Category

The BAC value represent the total cost for the resource budgeted for the project. This value is stored in the appropriate Project field as shown in the following table:

| Resource Category | Project Field |
|---|---|
| Labor Cost | BAC_LAB |
| Material Cost | BAC_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | BAC_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | BAC_SUB |

The BAC value stored in the project field is calculated by summing the values in the BAC field on the Activity table.

The calculations that are performed at the activity level depend on whether the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method option is selected on the Cost tab of the Project Properties dialog box.

By default, the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method is cleared for new projects. In this mode, Open Plan calculates BAC for each category by summing the values in either the unescalated cost field (RES_CST) or the escalated cost field (RES_ESC) in the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) on the Baseline Usage table. The value that Open Plan uses in this calculation is determined by a setting on the Cost Calculations dialog box:

- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is cleared on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the RES_CST field.
- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is selected on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the RES_ESC field.

By always using the PMB when it is available, Open Plan provides consistency and reliability. If there is no baseline named PMB, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple selected baselines, the baseline identified as Baseline 1. If the project contains baselines, but none is selected or named PMB, Open Plan prompts you to select a baseline. If the project has no baselines, Open Plan uses the Version 2 Cost Calculation Method automatically.

If the Use Version 2 Cost Calculation Method option is selected, Open Plan calculates the BAC value by summing the values in the Level field of the Assignment table adjusted for any curve, offset, and period that may be defined and multiplying this value by the appropriate category cost rate. The rate that Open Plan uses is determined by a setting on the Cost Calculations dialog box:

- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is cleared on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open plan uses the unit rate for all entries.
- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is selected on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the relevant escalated rates for each entry.

### Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the budgeted quantity of labor for the work scheduled for the project from the baseline start date of the project until Time Now. The Labor Quantity BCWS for the project is stored in the BCWS_QTY field on the Project table. This value is calculated by summing the values from the Activity table.

The values in the Activity table are calculated during cost calculations by summing the original (budgeted) labor resource quantity (RES_USED) value in the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) in the Baseline Usage table from the baseline start date until Time Now. By always using the PMB when it is available, Open Plan provides consistency and reliability.

If there is no baseline named PMB, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple selected baselines, the baseline identified as Baseline 1. If the project contains baselines, but none is selected or named PMB, Open Plan prompts you to select a baseline during cost calculations. If the project has no baselines, Open Plan uses the Version 2 Cost Calculation Method automatically. A baseline must be selected in order for Open Plan to calculate earned value.

#### Cost by Category

The BCWS value represent the total budgeted cost of the work scheduled for the project from the baseline start date of the project until Time Now. This value is stored in the appropriate Project field as shown in the following table:

| Resource Category | Project Field |
|---|---|
| Labor Cost | BCWS_LAB |
| Material Cost | BCWS_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | BCWS_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | BCWS_SUB |

The BCWS value stored in the project field is calculated by summing the values in the BCWS field on the Activity table.

The values in the Activity table are calculated during cost calculations by summing the values in either the unescalated cost field (RES_CST) or the escalated cost field (RES_ESC) for the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) in the Baseline Usage table from the baseline start date until Time Now. The field that Open Plan sums in this calculation is determined by a setting on the Cost Calculations dialog box:

- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is cleared on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the RES_CST field.
- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is selected on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the RES_ESC field.

By always using the PMB when it is available, Open Plan provides consistency and reliability. If there is no baseline named PMB, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple selected baselines, the baseline identified as Baseline 1. If the project contains baselines, but none is selected or named PMB, Open Plan prompts you to select a baseline. If the project has no baselines, Open Plan uses the Version 2 Cost Calculation Method. A baseline must be selected in order for Open Plan to calculate earned value.

### Budgeted Cost of Work Performed

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the earned value of labor resource units budgeted for the project. The Labor Quantity BCWP for the project is stored in the BCWP_QTY field on the Project table. This value is calculated by summing the values in the Activity table.

The values in the Activity table are calculated during cost calculations by summing the earned value of resource labor units (BCWP_QTY) in the Resource Cost table.

The earned value of resource labor units (BCWP_QTY) in the Resource Cost Table is calculated during cost calculations, by multiplying the physical percent complete of the assignment by the original (budgeted) labor resource quantity (RES_USED) value in the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) on the Baseline Usage table. By always using the PMB when it is available, Open Plan provides consistency and reliability.

If there is no baseline named PMB, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple selected baselines, the baseline identified as Baseline 1. If the project contains baselines, but none is selected or named PMB, Open Plan prompts you to select a baseline during cost calculations. If the project has no baselines, Open Plan uses the Version 2 Cost Calculation Method automatically. A baseline must be selected in order for Open Plan to calculate earned value.

Each time you calculate costs, an entry is added to the resource cost table that represents current period BCWP. For a new period, this value is calculated by subtracting the sum of all previous values from the new total calculated BCWP.

#### Cost by Category

The BCWP value represents the earned value of costs for the project. This value is stored in the appropriate Project field as shown in the following table:

| Resource Category | Project Field |
|---|---|
| Labor Cost | BCWP_LAB |
| Material Cost | BCWP_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | BCWP_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | BCWP_SUB |

The BCWP value stored in the project field is calculated by summing the values in the BCWP field on the Activity table.

The values in the Activity table are calculated during cost calculations by summing the values in either the unescalated cost field (BCWP_CST) or the escalated cost field (BCWP_ESC) in the Resource Cost table. The field that Open Plan uses in this calculation is determined by a setting on the Cost Calculations dialog box:

- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is cleared on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the BCWP_CST field.
- If the Use Resource Cost Escalation option is selected on the Cost Calculations dialog box, Open Plan uses the BCWP_ESC field.

### Actual Cost of Work Performed

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the actual number of labor resource units that have been used by the project. The Labor Quantity ACWP for the project is stored in the ACWP_QTY field on the Project table. This value is calculated by summing the values in the ACWP_QTY on the Activity table.

The ACWP_QTY values in the activity table are calculated during cost calculations based on one of the following conditions:

- If the Progress Based on Activity Progress option is selected on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates this value based on the progress reported on the activity.
- If the Progress Based on Activity Progress option is cleared on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates this value based on the values that have been entered on the Resources tab of the Activity Progress dialog box. These values are stored in the ACWP_QTY (and ACWP_CST and ACWP_ESC) fields of the Resource Cost table.

#### Cost by Category

The ACWP value represents the actual costs for the project. This value is stored in the appropriate Project field as shown in the following table:

| Resource Category | Project Field |
|---|---|
| Labor Cost | ACWP_LAB |
| Material Cost | ACWP_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | ACWP_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | ACWP_SUB |

The ACWP value stored in the project field is calculated by summing the values in the ACWP field on the Activity table.

The ACWP values in the Activity table are calculated during cost calculations based on one of the following conditions:

- If the Actual Cost Based on Progressed Quantity option is selected on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates this value based on the progressed quantity of the resource and stores it in the ACWP_CST and ACWP_ESC fields on the Resource Cost table. Then Open Plan rolls it up to the activity level.
- If the Actual Cost Based on Progressed Quantity option is cleared on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates this value based on the values that have been entered on the Resources tab of the Activity Progress dialog box and which are stored in the Resource Cost table. Open Plan summarizes these values to the activity level.

### Estimate to Complete

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the estimated remaining labor quantity for the project. The Labor Quantity ETC for the project is calculated summing the activity ETC values.

The ETC_QTY values in the activity table are calculated during cost calculations based on one or both of the following conditions:

- If the Progress Based on Activity Progress option is selected on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates remaining values automatically during cost calculations.
- If the Progress Based on Activity Progress option is cleared on the Resource Details dialog box, ETC_QTY is calculated at the activity level by summing the Remaining values on the Assignment table for Labor resources.

It is possible for some resources to be calculated automatically and some to be calculated manually.

#### Cost by Category

The ETC value represents the estimate of the remaining costs for the project. The ETC value at the project level is calculated by summing up the activity values stored in the appropriate Project field as shown in the following table:

| Resource Category | Project Field |
|---|---|
| Labor Cost | ETC_LAB |
| Material Cost | ETC_MAT |
| ODC (Other Direct Costs) | ETC_ODC |
| Subcontract Cost | ETC_SUB |

The ETC field in the Activity table is calculated by summing the remaining values on the Assignment table for each category. If the Progress Based on Activity Progress option is selected on the Resource Details dialog box, Open Plan calculates Remaining values during cost calculations.

### Estimate at Complete

#### Labor Quantity

This value represents the total of both the estimated and the completed labor quantities for the project. The Labor Quantity EAC for the project is calculated by first totaling the values in the ETC_QTY and the ACWP_QTY fields in the Activity table and then adding the resultant totals.

#### Cost by Category

The EAC value represents the estimate of the total costs for the project. The EAC value displayed on the Cost tab of the Project Properties dialog box is calculated by adding the values in the ETC and the ACWP fields for the appropriate categories.

The EAC field displayed on the Cost tab of the Activity Information dialog box is calculated by adding the ETC and ACWP values from the appropriate categories.

## Physical Percent Complete (PPC)

Physical percent complete is percentage of the work of an activity that has been achieved or completed. On the Resources tab of the Activity Progress dialog box, you can enter the PPC for an activity in two ways:

- At the resource level by entering the PPC in the resource's Phy. % field in the grid
- At the activity level by entering the PPC in the Activity Physical % Complete field at the top of the tab

The PPC fields at the resource level and at the activity level are interdependent and changing one value affects the other. In other words, when you enter a value in one field, Open Plan automatically calculates and enters the value in the other field in order to keep the two fields synchronized.

The following examples illustrate the two methods of entering PPC.

### Example One: Entering PPC at the Resource Level

Assume that the activity has two resource assignments (with linear requirements) as follows:

| Resource | Budget (qty) | Unit Cost | Budget Cost | PPC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Res1 | 10 | 60 | 600 | 50% |
| Res2 | 10 | 50 | 500 | 25% |

By entering the PPC at the resource level, Open Plan calculates the activity PPC using the following formula:

```
(PPCâ Ã BCâ) + (PPCâ Ã BCâ) + ... + (PPCâ Ã BCâ)
âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ
BCâ + BCâ + ... + BCâ
```

```
(0.5 Ã 600) + (0.25 Ã 500)   300 + 125   425
ââââââââââââââââââââââââââ = âââââââââ = ââââ = 38.6%
      600 + 500                1100      1100
```

Open Plan enters 38.6 in the Activity Physical % Complete field.

> **Note:** This method does not take into account duration, curve, offsets, and periods. It simply reflects what you enter.

### Example Two: Entering PPC at the Activity Level

By entering the activity PPC, Open Plan would calculate the resource PPCs with regard to duration, curve, offsets, and periods.

Here is the same information as in the first example but presented in a different format:

**Activity A**  
duration=20, PPC=8.6%

- **Resource 1**: level 1, offset=0, period=10, unit cost=60 BAC=600
- **Resource 2**: level 1, offset=5, period=10, unit cost=50 BAC=500

Because of the activity duration and the offset of the second resource, the two resources overlap. When you enter the activity PPC of 38.6%, Open Plan makes the following calculations:

First, Open Plan determines the earned value of the activity by multiplying the sum of the resource assignment BACs with the activity PPC you entered:

```
Earned value for the activity = (activity PPC Ã (sum of the res. assignment BACs))
                               = (38.6% Ã (600+500))
                               = 424.6
```

Next, Open Plan looks at the activity profile and determines in which period the earned value falls in relation to the resources:

**Profile**

| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 | 60 |
| R2 |  | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | ... |

Since only a fraction of the last period is used, Open Plan evenly distributes the earned unit amount between the two resources:

**Earned Profile**

| Resource | Periods | Final Period | Earned Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 60 Ã 6 periods | 7.3 | EV = 367.3 |
| R2 | 50 Ã 1 period | 7.3 | EV = 57.3 |

| Cumulative Earned Value | 60 | 120 | 180 | 240 | 300 | 410 | 424.6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then, Open Plan adds the earned value for each resource and divides by the resource's BAC to determine the PPC for the resource:

**PPC**
- R1: PPC = (367.3 / 600) = 61.2%
- R2: PPC = (57.3 / 500) = 11.4%

## Calculated Fields

To facilitate the reporting of cost information, Open Plan provides a number of standard calculated fields related to costs at the activity level. These fields are available for display in any view and are defined as follows.

### ACWPcum (Actual Cost of Work Performed)

This value represents the actual cost of the work performed on the activity or project from its inception to Time Now.

The ACWPcum is calculated according to the following formula:

```
ACWP_LAB + ACWP_MAT + ACWP_ODC + ACWP_SUB
```

Open Plan has two methods for acquiring actual quantity:

- You may enter the actual quantity directly into the Resources tab of the Activity Progress dialog box.
- You may allow Open Plan to calculate the actual quantity based on the activity status.

The method used depends on settings made on the General tab of the Resource Details dialog box.

### BACcum (Budget at Complete)

This value represents the total budgeted cost of the activity or project and is calculated from the costs of the Project Measurement Baseline (PMB) using the following formula:

```
BAC_LAB + BAC_MAT + BAC_ODC + BAC_SUB
```

If the PMB does not exist, Open Plan uses the currently selected baseline, or, in the case of multiple baselines, the first selected baseline.

### BCWPcum (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed)

This value represents the sum of the budgets for the completed work PMB. The cumulative budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) is frequently referred to as earned value (EV). This value is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BCWP_LAB + BCWP_MAT + BCWP_ODC + BCWP_SUB
```

### BCWScum (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled)

Activity BCWS (BCWScum) is a calculated field on the activity table that represents the cumulative to-date budgeted cost of work scheduled for the activity and is the sum of the BCWS for each resource category:

```
BCWS_LAB + BCWS_MAT + BCWS_ODC + BCWS_SUB
```

> **Note:** A baseline must be selected in order for Open Plan to calculate the Activity BCWS.

### CPI (Cost Performance Index)

This value represents the cost efficiency factor representing the relationship between the actual costs expended and the value of the physical work performed. This value is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BCWPcum / ACWPcum
```

### CV (Cost Variance)

This value represents the numerical difference between the earned value (BCWP) and the actual cost (ACWP) and is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BCWPcum â ACWPcum
```

### ETC (Estimate to Complete)

This calculated field shows the total ETC for an activity by combining the ETC for each resource category:

```
ETC_LAB + ETC_MAT + ETC_ODC + ETC_SUB
```

### EAC (Estimate at Complete)

This value represents the final costs of the activity or project when completed and is calculated from the current resource assignments. This value is calculated according to the following formula:

```
ACWPcum + ETC
```

### SPI (Schedule Performance Index)

This value is the planned schedule efficiency factor representing the relationship between the value of the initial planned schedule and the value of the physical work performed, earned value. This value is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BCWPcum / BCWScum
```

### SV (Schedule Variance)

This value is used as an indicator of how much a program is ahead or behind schedule and is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BCWPcum â BCWScum
```

### VAC (Variance at Complete)

This value represents the algebraic difference between Budget at Complete and Estimate at Complete and is calculated according to the following formula:

```
BACcum â EAC
```

## Multi-Project Operations

The extensive set of multi-project features in Open Plan allows you to break large projects down into smaller subprojects, thus providing for high-level summarizations of lower-level detail. The multi-project capabilities can also provide you with a method of rolling up smaller projects into a single master project in order to perform scheduling and resource planning functions at a more comprehensive level.

The multi-project capabilities of Open Plan serve two main purposes. The first is to allow cross project planning and scheduling for departments or smaller organizations. In this scenario, there are a number of individual projects sharing the same pool of resources.

A second use of multi-projects is to provide an integrated program management environment for large complex projects that have been broken down into subprojects. In this scenario, a master scheduler defines a master project as well as the external subproject components and then ownership of each component is given to individual team members.

This topic provides discussions of the following issues related to the multi-project capabilities of Open Plan:

- External subprojects
- The effect of the Save As command
- Relationships between projects
- Project target dates
- Data merging
- Baselines
- Cost calculations
- Data structures

### External Subprojects

External subprojects are complete projects represented as a single activity in a higher-level (master) project.

When you open an external subproject attached to a master project, the external subprojects will be opened in the same mode as the master project. If it is not possible to open the master project and the external subproject in the same mode, both the external subprojects as well as the master project are opened in the read-only mode.

In cases where you first open a master project and then open an external subproject during a subsequent operation, Open Plan may switch the access mode for the master project if the subproject cannot be opened in the same mode. If you have made changes to the master project, Open Plan allows you to save any changes before switching to the more restrictive mode.

When you elect to save a master project, all open external subprojects are saved back to their original files as well. If you attempt to save data to an external subproject that Open Plan was unable to open with the appropriate access mode (or for which you have insufficient rights), a message box is displayed.

### The Effect of the Save As Command

When you are in a master project, it is important to remember that the Save As command treats open external subprojects differently than it treats closed external subprojects. When you issue the Save As command, Open Plan merges open external subprojects into the master project as internal subprojects. On the other hand, closed external subprojects remain external to the master project, and links to these subprojects are maintained.

> **Note:** You cannot perform Save As on a file if there is another file open which refers to it.

### Interproject Relationships

Relationships may be entered as usual between any subproject or activity that can be viewed while updating the master project. To add relationships to activities that are part of external subprojects, the external subprojects must be open.

To enforce these constraints when external subprojects are accessed directly (that is, when not accessed as part of the master project), Open Plan inserts foreign activities as predecessors and/or successors to the relevant activities in the external subproject. Such activities have Foreign Activity as their activity type, and their dates are treated as On Target dates. Likewise, resource scheduling schedules these activities using their scheduled dates and assumes the Immediate option. This has the effect of enforcing dependencies created as part of the multi-project environment.

When Open Plan inserts a foreign activity in an external subproject, it also adds the necessary parent activities to make the ID of the foreign activity unique within the external subproject. These foreign parents also serve as a means of tracking where the external link comes from (that is, the project to which they refer). It is important to note that no operation should be performed on foreign activities or their parents.

### Project Target Dates

When saving external subprojects from within a master project, Open Plan checks for the existence of a foreign subproject or foreign activity. If none exists, Open Plan sets a target project finish date for the external subproject. If necessary, Open Plan also sets a project target start to create a relationship with the external subproject activity.

The project start date that is created could overwrite a target start date previously set for the master project.

### Data Merging Issues

When external subprojects are opened from within a master project, the data from the subproject is effectively merged into the current project. To perform this operation, Open Plan validates that the master project and all external subprojects use the same ancillary files.

When you open a hierarchical project in Open Plan that contains external subprojects, the program checks that the master project has the same ancillary data files attached to the various external subprojects. For example, if you have attached two code files to an external subproject, the master project must have the same two code files attached to it as well.

Open Plan can make these ancillary file assignments only when either the master project or the external subproject does not have an ancillary file of that type assigned. If, for example, the master file uses Resource File A and the external subproject uses Resource File B, Open Plan will not be able to merge the data and the external subproject project will not open.

For the purposes of merging data, Open Plan ignores the Default calendar file. This means that if, for example, an external subproject uses the Default calendar file and the master project uses another calendar file, the calendar file that is assigned to the master project will also be assigned to the external subproject.

In the case of code files, Open Plan also validates that the master project and all external subprojects attach the code file to the same code field and makes the appropriate assignments where necessary. This can have the result of assigning the same code file to more than one code field.

For example, assume that the master project has a code file named Location assigned to Code Field 1 and that Code Field 2 is empty. Assume also that an external subproject has a code file named Location assigned to Code Field 2 and that Code Field 1 is empty. When the data is merged, Open Plan assigns Location to Code Field 2 in the master project and to Code Field 1 in the external subproject.

### Baseline Issues

Security permitting, a baseline created at the master project level is visible in the subprojects. The owner of the baseline can grant rights to other users for viewing and/or changing the baseline. Thus, users who have authorization are able to access and update baselines from an external subproject.

When a baseline is selected, the baseline data is opened for the main project and for all open subprojects. When a subproject is opened subsequent to the selection of a baseline, the subproject baseline data needs to be read.

### Cost Calculations

When you perform cost calculations for a master project that includes external subprojects, Open Plan calculates the budgeted and actual costs for any open external subprojects and then rolls up the costs to the master project level. This activity-level cost information is saved back to the external subprojects when a save is performed.

The calculation of budgeted costs is based on the information stored in the resource file assigned to the project at that time. (The same holds true for the calculation of actual costs if the Actual Cost Based on Progress Quantity option has been selected.) Thus, even if you have previously calculated the cost at the subproject level, these values are recalculated when you run cost calculations at the master project level.

Since the cost information related to activities is saved back to the external subproject level but the information from the resource file is not, it is possible that you will get different costs totals depending on whether you calculate costs in the master project or in the external subproject. To verify which unit costs will be used to calculate activity and resource costs, check the resource file assigned to the project before performing the calculation.

# Reporting

## Customizing Barchart Views

Open Plan provides you with complete control over the appearance of bars within a barchart view. This control allows you to create customized reports based on the standard barchart views by changing options such as:

- The conditions under which the bar is displayed
- The dates represented by the bar
- The appearance and characteristics of the bar, symbols, and accompanying text

### Defining Bar Sets

A bar set is a group of activity or resource assignment bars that you can assign to a barchart view. For example, you might have a particular style of bar to show a critical activity and another bar to show an activity that is not critical.

You can change how Open Plan displays bars in a barchart through the Bar Sets dialog box. Open Plan displays this dialog box when you click Bar Sets on the View tab or when you right-click anywhere in the barchart portion of the view and click Bar Sets on the context menu.

The two sets of standard bar sets that are selectable in the top-most field of the Bar Sets dialog box are:

- Activity Bar Sets
- Multi-table Bar Sets

The Bar Sets dialog box allows you to perform the following functions:

- Select the bar set to which the bar views apply
- Assign a bar set to the current view simply by selecting it from the list and clicking OK
- Create a new bar set that can be used with any barchart view
- Copy an existing bar set and modify it to meet new requirements
- Edit an existing bar set
- Delete a bar set that is no longer required

On the Bar Sets dialog box, clicking New or selecting a bar set and clicking Copy or Edit displays the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box.

### Bar Set Attributes

In Open Plan, bar attributes specify the criterion an activity must meet in order to display a particular bar. Each bar attribute consists of a bar label (for the legend), a filter expression, and a definition of the bar type and display characteristics. User-defined bar attributes are a flexible and efficient way of customizing barchart views, making it possible to have the display of the bars driven by any information stored for the activity in Open Plan. For example, you could indicate varying degrees of criticality by displaying differently colored bars for non-critical, critical, and super-critical activities. You might wish to display high-level summary bars for most activities, with a smaller number of key activities exploded to show more detail.

The preview area at the bottom of the dialog box displays the currently selected bar attribute. You can select multiple attributes and preview how different bars will look together.

The Print button allows you to print the attributes chosen in the Bar Set Preferences dialog box. This is useful when modeling other bar sets after one another.

#### To customize bar attributes

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Bar Sets.
   - Right-click an empty area in a barchart view, and click Bar Sets on the context menu.

2. From the Bar Sets dialog box, select the bar set you would like to edit and click Edit.

3. On the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, enter the information for each set of attributes that you want to customize.
   - To define a new set of attributes, scroll to the empty line at the bottom of the list, and enter the information for the attributes.
   - To delete a set of attributes, select the row and press the Delete key.

4. When your changes are complete, click OK to return the Bar Sets dialog box.

To display the bar set you just edited, select it from the list and click either OK or Select.

### Defining Custom Bar Types

Each bar type in Open Plan represents a definition of a bar: the start and finish dates used to position the bar, the symbols placed to the left and right of the bar, the shape and dimensions of the bar, and so on. Although the barchart views supplied with Open Plan define many standard bar types, it is also possible to customize these bar types or to create new types.

To define a custom bar type, click Bar Types on the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box. Open Plan responds by displaying the Bar Types dialog box.

#### To customize bar types, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Bar Sets.
   - Right-click an empty area within the barchart, and click Bar Sets on the context menu.

2. From the Bar Sets dialog box, select the bar set you would like to edit and click Edit.

3. On the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, click Bar Types.

4. Enter the information for each bar type you want to customize.
   - To define a new bar type, scroll to the empty line at the bottom of the list, and enter the information for the bar type.
   - To delete an existing bar type, click the bar type row and press the Delete key.
   - To select multiple bar types, press the Shift or Ctrl keys and click the selection buttons to the left of the desired rows.
   - To adjust the row height for the bar type, enter a value in the Row Height field in hundredths of an inch.

5. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box.

> **Attention:** For more information and field descriptions, see Views and Reports Â» Barchart View Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Bar Types Dialog Box in the Deltek Open Plan online help.

### Defining Text Layout for Bars

For each bar type, you can define as many as 15 different positions in which text is displayed. The following illustration and table shows the possible positions for bar text:

- 1 â Left top
- 2 â Left middle
- 3 â Left bottom
- 4 â Center left top
- 5 â Center left middle
- 6 â Center left bottom
- 7 â Center top
- 8 â Center middle
- 9 â Center bottom
- 10 â Center right top
- 11 â Center right middle
- 12 â Center right bottom
- 13 â Right top
- 14 â Right middle
- 15 â Right bottom

You can display any text, numeric, or date field for the activity using this feature.

To define the text layout of a bar, click Text Layout on the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box. Open Plan responds by displaying the following dialog box.

To use an opaque background for bar text, click Opaque Text. If you do not click this option, items such as relationship lines will display behind the text.

> **Note:** If you want a displayed field to include literal text (for example, "Total Float =") as a label for activity data, define a calculated field for the project using a text string and the appropriate data. For information about defining calculated fields, see Defining Calculated Fields.

#### To customize text layout, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Bar Sets.
   - Right-click an empty area within the barchart and click Bar Sets on the context menu.

2. From the Bar Sets dialog box, select the bar set you would like to edit and click Edit.

3. On the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, click Text Layout.

4. Enter the information for the text to be display for each bar type.
   - To attach a new text field to a bar type, enter the information for the field on a new line.
   - To delete an existing assignment, select the row with the assignment and press the Delete key.
   - To define the font used to display the text, click the ellipsis button next to the edit box for that setting.

5. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box.

### Examples of Custom Bars

By setting up different combinations of bar attributes and bar types, you can produce customized barchart views that can display selected levels of summarization or detail. In the following examples, you can see how to define three sets of special-purpose bars in Open Plan:

- Summary bars based on an activity code
- Summary bars with milestones
- Summary bars with major milestones

#### Summary Bars Based on an Activity Code

For this example of summary bars, assume that you want to produce a barchart in which bars showing early dates have fill patterns that correspond to an activity code that represents different organizational responsibilities:

- Test
- Assembly
- Fabrication
- Design

When you roll up the detail bars using outlining, you want the summary bars to continue to display the different fill patterns.

To set up this type of barchart, you need to define a single bar type to show early dates.

Assume that you want an activity code stored in a code field to drive the fill patterns for the bars:

| Code 1 Value | Description |
|---|---|
| D | Design |
| F | Fabrication |
| A | Assembly |
| T | Test |

You could then set up filters based on the different code values (these will serve as bar criteria) and then define the following attributes for the detail bars and a summary bar.

Notice that while all bars use the same bar type, the various criteria serve to associate particular codes with different fill patterns.

Notice also the use of the visibility parameter to control the display of detail and summary bars. Bars with the code-based fill pattern will display bars at both the detail level and at the summary level immediately above the detail level. This allows the bars to be displayed for detail activities as well as when the activities are rolled up to the next summary level. The summary bar, on the other hand, appears at the detail level only.

#### Summary Bars with Milestones

Another common reporting requirement is to show multiple milestones for a single summary bar. For example, assume that your project consists of the following detail and summary activities.

When rolled up, the bars would look like this.

To achieve this effect, you must first define three bar types: an early bar showing early dates for detail and summary bars, and two special bars for milestones that appear above and below the summary bar when the detail activities are rolled up.

Notice that the two milestone bar types do not have a left symbol or a bar shape. When these bars appear in a barchart, only the right symbol is displayed. Notice also how the height and offset parameters for the milestone bars straddle the position occupied by the early bar.

To understand how the bar attributes could be set up for this type of barchart, assume that you want an activity code to determine whether an activity milestone should be displayed above or below the summary bar:

| Code 2 Value | Description |
|---|---|
| U | Above the summary bar |
| D | Below the summary bar |

You could then set up filters based on the two code values (these will serve as bar criteria) and then define the following attributes for the bars.

As in the previous example, notice the use of the visibility parameter to control the display of detail and summary bars. In this case, early bars are displayed for detail activities; when rolled up to the next level, however, the activities appear as milestones. The value of the Code 2 field determines whether the milestone marker for the activity appears above or below the summary bar.

#### Summary Bars with Major Milestones

For high-level executive summaries, it is useful to set up barcharts in which detail activities can be rolled up through a series of milestones representing higher levels of summarization. For example, assume that a subproject has been broken down into two phases.

When rolled up to the next level, the detail activities appear as milestones, with two milestones representing the completion dates of each phase.

When rolled up to the highest level of summarization, only the major milestones appear.

Displaying major milestones requires defining a bar type in addition to the bar types used to display lower-level milestones.

Bar attributes for this barchart would be as follows.

For this example, a bar attribute for major milestones is defined, and another value for Code 2 (M for major milestones) is utilized for the criterion. The visibility parameter for major milestones is set to be visible at all levels.

## Displaying Time-Phased Data

The standard multi-table barcharts in Open Plan allow you to display time-phased cost and resource data in the barchart portion of the view.

You can display cost and resource information based on either resources or earned value (forecasts, BCWS, BCWP, or ACWP). Open Plan time-phases this information based on the smallest time period defined by the barchart date scale. Thus, the information displayed by a data bar corresponds to the cost information displayed in a resource histogram that includes a table.

### Crosstable Tab

To control the display of time-phased data, multi-table barchart views include an additional tab in the Barchart Preferences dialog box â the Crosstable tab.

Similar to the Bar Attributes tab, the Crosstable tab allows you to define a number of parameters for cost data "bars":

- Criterion
- Crosstable bar type (which corresponds to the Bar Type setting on the Bar Attributes tab)
- Outline (used to specify the font color)
- Fill color
- Visibility (five levels of detail):
  - All levels of rollup and detail
  - Detail and immediate rollup level
  - Detail level only
  - Immediate rollup level only
  - Not visible
- Label

You can also use this tab to indicate if you want to display resource costs, earned value costs, or suppress the display of costs altogether. The Crosstable tab controls the set of bar attributes appear in the dialog box.

The Crosstable tab also includes buttons for two commands: the Crosstable command and the Details command. The following sections describe each of these commands.

> **Attention:** For a complete description of each of these parameters, see Bar Set Attributes.

### The Crosstable Command

If you click the Crosstable button on the Crosstable tab, Open Plan displays the Crosstable Types dialog box.

Use the Crosstable Types dialog box to define the following information for each crosstable bar type:

- **Crosstable Type** â The name of the crosstable type typically reflects the dates represented by the bar. For example, the crosstable type RESchedule might refer to data based on schedule dates.

- **Dates** â If you are defining a bar to display resource data, you can define one of the following pairs of dates to use for the bar:
  - **Early** â Resource assignments based on the early dates calculated by time analysis
  - **Late** â Resource assignments based on the late dates calculated by time analysis
  - **Schedule** â Resource assignments based on the scheduled dates calculated by resource scheduling (these assignments can show the effects of splitting, stretching, and reprofiling activities)
  - **Baseline 1, 2, and 3** â Baseline resource assignments using the dates (early, late, or scheduled) selected at the time that you created the baseline(s) currently attached to the project
  - **Actual** â Actual resource costs or quantities based on resource progress information
  - **Availability** â Resource availabilities

  If you are defining a bar to display earned value, use the Dates setting to display one of the following types of costs:
  - **Forecast** â Open Plan determines the forecast cost or quantity (Estimate At Complete or EAC) of a resource by adding any actuals prior to Time Now to any planned costs or quantities subsequent to Time Now.
  - **Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS)** â BCWS is derived from the planned resource budget stored in the current baseline for the project. This budget may be based on early, late, or scheduled dates, depending on the dates used to create the baseline.
  - **Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP)** â ACWP is based on the actual costs recorded for the resource.
  - **Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP)** â To calculate BCWP, Open Plan applies the value for the physical completion of the activity (or activities) to the corresponding portion of the planned resource budget (as defined in the current project baseline). For example, if you indicate that an activity has a physical complete value of 50%, Open Plan calculates BCWP for an assigned resource by determining how much of its planned budget (BCWS) corresponds to the first half of the activity duration.

- **Font** â Specifies the font.

- **Offset** â Defines the distance from the top of the bar to the top of the row. Specify this setting in hundredths of an inch.

- **Zeros** â Controls the display of zero values in a bar as follows:
  - **Ignore** â Never display zero values
  - **Restricted** â Restrict the display of zero values to the date span defined for the bar
  - **Always** â Display zero values for each time period defined for the barchart

- **Decimals** â Controls the number of decimal places that Open Plan should display on the bar.

The Crosstable Types dialog box also includes a setting for defining the row height in hundredths of an inch.

> **Note:** This dialog box corresponds to the Bar Types dialog box that you can use to define custom bar types.

#### To customize crosstable bar types, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Bar Sets.
   - Right-click an empty area within the barchart and click Bar Sets.

2. From the Bar Sets dialog box, select the bar set you would like to edit and click Edit.

3. On the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, click the Crosstables tab.

4. Indicate whether you want to display resource or earned value data, and click Crosstable.

5. Enter the information for each crosstable bar type you want to customize.
   - To define a new bar type, scroll to the empty line at the bottom of the list and enter the information for the crosstable type.
   - To delete an existing crosstable type, click the crosstable type row and press the Delete key.
   - To select multiple crosstable types, press the Shift or Ctrl keys and click the selection buttons to the left of the desired rows.

6. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the Crosstable tab.

> **Attention:** For more information about defining row height, see Defining Custom Bar Types.

# Reporting Developer's Guide

## The Details Command

If you click the Details command from the Crosstable tab, Open Plan displays a dialog box that allows you to define the information appearing in a bar. The type of dialog box that appears depends on whether you choose to display resource or earned value data.

If you have indicated that you want to display resource data, Open Plan displays the following dialog box when you click the Details button:

Use this dialog box to enter the following information:

**Show** â You can display values for one of the following:

- **Resources** â Select this option to display details for resources.
- **Skills** â Select this option to display details for skills.

**Calculate** â You can have Open Plan display resource data in terms of either resource units, base unit costs, or escalated costs.

**Values** â You can control which values appear with one of the following options:

- **Average** â Resource costs represent an average value per the default duration unit used by the project. Open Plan calculates this average over the smallest time unit displayed on the date scale and uses the default project calendar to determine valid working periods. (If you have not assigned a calendar to the project, Open Plan assumes a 5-day, 40-hour work week with no holidays.)
- **Total** â Total resource costs or quantities.
- **Period** â Resource data corresponds to the smallest time unit displayed on the date scale.

**Scale Factor** â You can define a scale factor for the information so that, for example, all values represent thousands of dollars.

If you have indicated that you want to display earned value data, Open Plan displays the following dialog box when you click Details on the Crosstable tab:

Use this dialog box to enter the following information.

**Show**

**Forecast Dates** â If you choose to display time-phased forecast data, you can base planned costs or quantities on early, late, or scheduled dates.

**Calculate** â You can have Open Plan display earned value in terms of either resource units, base unit costs, or escalated costs.

**Values for** â You can control which values appear in the view with one of the following options:

- **Total** â Earned value costs represent the total for the resource.
- **Period** â Earned value data corresponds to the smallest time unit displayed on the date scale.

**Scale Factor** â You can define a scale factor for the information so that, for example, all values represent thousands of dollars.

To define crosstable details, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Bar Sets.
   - Right-click an empty area within the barchart, and click Bar Sets.
2. From the Bar Sets dialog box, select the bar set you would like to edit and click Edit.
3. On the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, select the Crosstables tab.
4. Indicate whether or not you want to display resource or earned value data, and click Details.
5. Enter the information for the contents of the cost data bars.
6. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the Crosstables tab.

## Customizing Network Views

You can customize both the appearance and the contents of activity boxes displayed in a network view. This document describes the facilities for customizing box attributes and text.

> **Attention:** For information about modifying other aspects of a network view, see Views and Reports Â» Network View in the Open Plan online help.

### Custom Box Attributes

Open Plan allows you to control the appearance of activity boxes in a network view by using data-driven box attributes. Like bar attributes in a barchart view, box attributes specify the criterion an activity must meet to display a particular style of box in a network view.

Each set of box attributes consists of a filter expression, a definition of how an activity satisfying the filter expression should appear in the view, and a box label for the legend. You can use these attributes to define the following characteristics of a box:

- The color of the lines and text of the box
- The shape of the box ends
- The fill color appearing within the box ends
- The presence or absence of diagonal markings in the box

To set custom attributes for boxes, display the Box Attributes tab of the Network Preferences dialog box:

Open Plan uses a set of standard attributes to display boxes for all activities that do not satisfy any of the listed criteria. These standard attributes are as follows:

- Text color â black
- Left end style â square ( [ )
- Right end style â square ( ] )
- Left fill color â white
- Right fill color â white
- Left diagonal â none
- Right diagonal â none
- Label â blank

This set of standard attributes also serves as the basis for all subsequent attributes appearing below it on the list. This feature of obtaining characteristics from previously defined attributes allows for activity boxes that can display different combinations of attributes by satisfying two or more criteria.

You can customize each box attribute with the following settings:

- **Criterion** â The box criterion defines the filter condition that the activity must meet in order to display a specific type of box. When specifying a box criterion, you can select an existing filter from the list.
- **Text Color** â The color of the activity box and text
- **Bk. Color** â The background color.
- **Left Style** â The end style used for the left edge of the box. Open Plan allows you to select an end style from a list displayed when you enter the field.
- **Left Color** â The color at the left end of the box.
- **Right Style** â The end style used for the right edge of the box
- **Right Color** â The color at the right end of the box.
- **Left Diag** â The use of the left diagonal mark (\)
- **Right Diag** â The use of the right diagonal mark (/)
- **Label** â Box labels appear next to boxes in the network legend. If you do not enter a label for a set of attributes, Open Plan uses the name of the criterion for the box label.

All attributes other than box criteria and labels have a possible setting of <Default>. If you select this setting, the box obtains the setting from a set of attributes appearing higher on the list.

To define custom box attributes, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences.
   - Right-click an empty area within the view, and click Preferences on the context menu.
2. On the Network Preferences dialog box click the Box Attributes tab.
3. Enter the information for each attribute.
   - To display all of the attribute settings in the dialog box, use the scroll bar.
   - To delete an attribute, select any cell in the row, and press the Delete key.
   - To select multiple sets of attributes, press the Shift or Ctrl keys and click the selection buttons to the left of the desired rows.
4. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the view.

### Combining Box Attributes

In one important respect, defining box attributes for a network view differs from defining bar attributes for a barchart view. In a barchart view, bar attributes are never combined â each bar attribute affects the appearance of a bar without regard for other attributes. In a network view, different box attributes can be combined for activities that satisfy more than one criterion.

To produce these combinations, Open Plan uses the settings from the lowest-listed criterion satisfied by the activity to display the box. Any undefined attributes obtain their values from relevant criteria appearing higher in the list.

> **Attention:** For more information about the combination of box attributes, refer to the "Combining Box Attributes" section below.

At the highest level of the attribute hierarchy is a standard set of attributes. Open Plan uses these standard attributes to display activities that do not satisfy any of the listed criteria as well as to provide settings for undefined attributes.

Since attributes appearing at the bottom of the list can obtain values from attributes listed above them, the order in which attributes appear in the dialog box is significant.

To understand how the combination of box attributes works, imagine that you want to base the appearance of boxes on three sets of overlapping criteria: activity status, responsibility, and criticality.

For activity status, assume that you want to use diagonal markings to indicate if an activity is either in-progress or complete:

To indicate organizational responsibility for the activity, you want to use the left and right end styles to represent the following codes from an OBS code file:

Finally, you want the fill of the box ends to indicate how critical the activity is:

It is possible to express all the possible combinations of these conditions by defining 27 different criteria for activities, each with its own set of attributes. It is also possible to set up just 7 criteria as the following table illustrates.

| Criterion | Text Color | Left Style | Left Fill | Right Style | Right Fill | Left Diag. | Right Diag. |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| In progress | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \ | \<D> |
| Complete | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \ | / |
| Dept_1 | \<D> | Blunt | \<D> | Blunt | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> |
| Dept_2 | \<D> | Round | \<D> | Round | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> |
| Dept_3 | \<D> | Angle | \<D> | Angle | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> |
| Critical | \<D> | \<D> | Black | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> | \<D> |
| Super-critical | \<D> | \<D> | Black | \<D> | Black | \<D> | \<D> |

> **Note:** In the above table, \<D> represents the \<Default> value for a setting.

To understand how Open Plan displays a given activity box based on these attributes, start at the bottom of the list and find the first criterion satisfied by the activity. Any attributes defined for that row are displayed. To determine settings for undefined attributes, continue up the list to the next criterion that the activity satisfies. If an attribute remains undefined after you have examined all the listed criteria, Open Plan uses the standard setting for that attribute.

For example, a critical in-progress activity that is assigned to Dept_2 would be displayed as follows:

This specific combination of attributes is the result of Open Plan applying the following rules when displaying the activity:

- The initial definition of the activity is based on the critical criterion, the first criterion that is satisfied by the activity. Only the left fill color is defined for this criterion â all other settings are based on criteria higher in the list.
- The left and right end styles are based on the definition for activities with an OBS code of Dept_2, the next criterion satisfied by the activity.
- The In-progress criterion results in the left diagonal being drawn in the activity box.
- The settings for text color, right fill color, and right diagonal are based on the standard set of attributes since these settings are not defined for any criterion applying to the activity.

### Custom Box Text

You can customize a network view to display any activity field (including calculated fields) in the activity boxes. Boxes can contain as many as 50 different data items displayed on a maximum of 20 lines. You can also display activity fields as graphic progress bars or display blank lines in a box.

To customize the layout of activity boxes, display the Box Layout tab of the Network Preferences dialog box:

The preview area of the dialog box displays the current definition of the activity boxes.

Notice that Open Plan displays data items in the dialog box in order of line number. When you add, delete, or change data items, you must exit and return to the dialog box to display the items in the correct line sequence.

Open Plan displays items sharing the same line from left to right based on the order in which the items appear in the list. To move an item to a different position in the list, use the Change Order buttons.

You can customize the layout of the activity box with the following settings.

- **Field** â You can select any activity field for display.
- **Line** â For each field appearing in the activity box, you must assign a line number. Activity boxes can contain up to 20 lines, and each line can display one or more fields. If you assign multiple fields to a single line, the order in which the fields are listed in the dialog box determines how Open Plan displays the fields in the box. To display a blank line in the activity box, do not enter settings for that line. For example, to display activity boxes with a double-high blank line, use the following settings:

| Field | Line | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| Activity Identifier | 1 | 1 line |
| Duration | 1 | 1 line |
| Early Start Date | 4 | 1 line |
| Early Finish Date | 4 | 1 line |

> **Note:** This representation may differ slightly in size and aspect ratio from the actual display of boxes in the view.

This results in the following activity box:

- **Font** â You can select the font type for the standard or calculated fields in the activity file.
- **Text Color** â You can specify the text color for the standard or calculated fields in the activity file.
- **Horz. Align** â You can specify the horizontal alignment of the text. The options available for this column are the following: Center, Left, and Right.
- **Vert. Align** â You can specify the vertical alignment of the text. The options available for this column are the following: Bottom, Center, and Top.
- **Max. Lines** â You can specify the maximum lines in the box on which the text is to be displayed.
- **Max Width** â You can specify the maximum width of the box on which the text is to be displayed.
- **Format** â You can specify the number of lines that the field may use to display data.

The option to show an activity field as a progress bar allows you to define activity boxes that can represent some types of activity information (for example, schedule progress) graphically:

To be displayed as a progress bar within the activity box, a field should represent a percentage value such as percent complete or physical percent complete. While a single activity box can contain multiple progress bars, you can display only one progress bar per line.

To customize the box layout, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences.
   - Right-click an empty area within the view and click Preferences on the context menu.
2. On the Network Preferences dialog box click the Box Layout tab.
3. Enter the information for each data item.
   - To change the order of the items, click any cell in a row and click one of the Change Order buttons.
   - To delete an item from the list, click any cell in the row and press the Delete key.
4. When your changes are complete, click OK to return to the view.

### Conditional Formatting

You can customize the display of the activity boxes for the Network View by using the Conditional Formatting dialog box:

With the Conditional Formatting dialog box, you can override these default settings by specifying the conditions under which the properties of the activity boxes will change. For example, you may want an activity box that exceeds a particular criterion or filter to appear in bold red text, show a symbol, or display in a different background.

The following columns in the grid are used to define each formatting rule:

- **Applies To** â select any of the standard or calculated fields.
- **Criterion** â select one of the following:
  - A calculated field that evaluates to a Boolean (True/False) value or a filter
  - An on-the-fly expression that evaluates to a Boolean
  - A blank, indicating that the rule will be unconditionally applied
- **Font** â select a font, font style, and/or size.
- **Text Color** â select from the color palette.
- **Background** â select from the color palette
- **Alignment** â select either center, left or right.
- **Image** â select the appropriate symbol from either the drop-down list or the Manage Symbols dialog box.
- **Image Context** â select one of the following:
  - **< None >** â Removes any image that may have been set in a rule on a higher row in the grid.
  - **< Default >** â Retains the attributes of the prevailing rule on a higher row in the grid.
  - **Centered in cell** â data is superimposed on the symbol which is centered.
  - **Adjacent to data** â both data and symbol are displayed in the same cell.
  - **Replaces data** â only symbol is displayed.
- **Show This Explanation** â specify the explanatory text you want to display when you hover your cursor over the row or cell. Use explanatory text to describe not only why a value is highlighted, but what the user should do about it.

> **Note:** This dialog box shares similar functionalities with the Set Column/Row Attributes dialog box. Although they differ in the fact that you are not able to assign formats to rows in the Applies To column.

To customize the display of the activity boxes for the Network View using the Conditional Formatting dialog box, complete the following steps:

1. Open the project in Network View.
2. Right-click the view and select Conditional Formatting.
3. The Conditional Formatting dialog box opens.
4. Select a field under the Applies To column.
5. Once you have selected a field to format, you may choose a criterion or any other attribute to modify the same field.
6. To make a formatting selection, click the drop-down list and/or the ellipsis box, if present.
7. When finished making selections, click OK.

## Customizing Resource Histogram Views

Three operations allow you to customize resource histogram views in Open Plan:

- Selecting resources
- Defining histogram display options
- Customizing the date scale

### Selecting Resources

Before you can display data in a resource histogram, you must select the resource(s) to include in the view. When you click Select Resource on the View tab (or select Select Resource from the context menu), Open Plan displays the Resource Selection dialog box:

The list field at the top of the dialog box allows you can to filter the display of resources by category:

- All Resource Categories
- Labor
- Material
- Other Direct Costs
- Subcontract

A resource's category is defined on the General tab of the Resource Details dialog box.

The Expand All button will expand the entire hierarchy for viewing.

To display a resource from the list, simply select the check box next to the resource name. To select all the resources, click the Select All button.

You can also choose to display resource pools in the histogram. Keep in mind, however, that all availabilities, requirements, and usage displayed for a pool include both the pool and a roll-up of the child resources belonging to the pool. Clearing the Hide Unreferenced Resources setting displays the entire resource use file hierarchy, which makes the resource pools available for selection.

The Show options determine how Open Plan displays bars or curves representing more than one resource. There are three choices:

- **Total** â This option displays the resource bars or curves for multiple resources as a total quantity. You cannot discern the amount of resource requirement or usage within a time frame for any specific resource.
- **Stacked** â This option displays the resources bars for multiple resources in a stacked format. Each selected resource is displayed in a separate color. In the case of cumulative values, Open Plan displays separate S-curves for each resource.
- **Category** â This option displays the resource bars for each resource category. In the case of cumulative values, Open Plan displays separate S-curves for each resource category.

> **Note:** When selecting resources to display, be sure that all selected resources use the same time unit. For example, you should not mix resources measured in person-hours and resources measured in person-days or person-weeks in the same bar.

If you select both a pool and any other pool or individual resource, the histogram displays each pool as a total histogram bar or S-curve.

To select resources, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Select Resource.
   - Right-click anywhere in the view, and click Select Resource on the context menu.
2. Select one or more resources from the list displayed in the dialog box.
3. To select all the resources, click Select All.
4. Indicate if the bars and curves should be total, stacked, or category.
5. When the information is complete, click OK to return to the view.

If you have applied a filter to the view, a resource histogram represents only those activities that satisfy the filter.

> **Attention:** For information about filters, see Histogram Views.

### Resource Histogram Display Options

To define the appearance of bars in a resource histogram view, click Preferences on the View tab or right-click within the histogram view and click Preferences on the context menu to display the Options tab of the Histogram Preferences dialog box:

With this dialog box, you can indicate whether you want to display resource information or earned value information and if you want to display a graph only, a table only, or a combination of the two. If you display a table, you can indicate how many decimal places should be displayed.

You also have the option of specifying the bar style (3-dimensional or flat). If multiple bars are displayed, you can specify their display as either side-by-side or front-to-back. If you choose to display flat bars front-to-back, Open Plan varies the width of the bars to distinguish between the different types of information being displayed, for example:

```
Early dates
Late dates
Schedule dates
```

You can also set the following options:

- **Scale Factor** â This setting determines how Open Plan scales the values appearing in the histogram bar or S-curves. For no scaling, set the scale factor to 1.
- **Max Y Value** â This setting determines the highest value displayed on the vertical axis of the histogram bars or S-curves. To allow Open Plan to set a maximum value based on the data, leave this setting at 0.
- **Number of Decimal Places** â This field controls the number of decimal places that Open Plan should display on the histogram. You can specify any value between 0 and 5.
- **Time Now** â You can select from the following options:
  - **None** â If you select this option, Open Plan does not display the Time Now line on the histogram.
  - **Line** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies Time Now using a vertical line. There is no identifying text beside the Time Now line.
  - **Line with Text** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies Time Now using a vertical line. In addition, the words "Time Now" are displayed next to the Time Now line.

If the histogram is displayed as a pane in the barchart view, Open Plan also features the following additional options:

- **Conditional Line** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies Time Now using a vertical line only if the barchart identifies Time Now with a vertical line. If the barchart does not identify Time Now in this way, the histogram does not identify Time Now.
- **Conditional Text** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies Time Now using both a vertical line and the text specified as the label in the Barchart Preferences dialog box only if the barchart identifies Time Now with a vertical line and a label. If the barchart does not identify Time Now in this way, the histogram displays Time Now with only a vertical line.

**Resource Description** â You can select from the following options:

- **Show Full ID** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies each resource by the full resource ID. For example, the resource may be identified as: `TEAM.LAB.JOAN`
- **Show Local ID** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies each resource by the local portion of the resource ID. For example, the resource may be identified as: `JOAN` (Where: JOAN is the local portion of the TEAM.LAB.JOAN resource ID.)
- **Show Description** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies each resource only by its description. For example, the resource may be identified as: `JOAN SHERWOOD` (Where: JOAN SHERWOOD is the resource description.)
- **Show Full ID and Description** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies each resource by both the full resource ID and the description. For example, the resource may be identified as: `TEAM.LAB.JOAN JOAN SHERWOOD` (Where: TEAM.LAB.JOAN is the full resource ID. JOAN SHERWOOD is the resource description.)
- **Show Local ID and Description** â If you select this option, Open Plan identifies each resource by both the local portion of the resource ID and the description. For example, the resource may be identified as: `JOAN JOAN SHERWOOD` (Where: JOAN is the local portion of the resource ID. JOAN SHERWOOD is the resource description.)

**Font** â Clicking this button displays the Font dialog box that you can use to customize the font used in the histogram view.

To define histogram display options, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences from the Histogram group (in a barchart view) or Preferences (in a histogram view).
   - Right-click anywhere in the view, and click Preferences on the context menu.
2. On the Options tab of the Histogram Preferences dialog box, enter the information for the display options.
3. When the information is complete, click OK to return to the view.

### Customizing the Date Scale

You can customize the date scale appearing in a stand-alone resource histogram view using the same procedures that you use to customize the date scale in a barchart view. (In fact, when a resource histogram appears in a barchart view, the barchart date scale controls the histogram portion of the view as well.)

> **Attention:** For information about customizing the date scale, see Customizing the Date Scale.

## Customizing Risk Histogram Views

Three operations allow you to customize risk histogram views in Open Plan:

- Selecting a key activity
- Defining histogram display options
- Customizing the date scale

### Selecting a Key Activity

Open Plan allows you to select the activity that appears in the view using the following dialog box:

To select a key activity, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Select Activity.
   - Right-click anywhere in the view, and click Select Activity on the context menu.
2. Select an activity from the list displayed in the dialog box, and click OK to return to the view.

### Risk Histogram Display Options

To define the appearance of a risk histogram view, display the Risk Analysis Preferences dialog box:

With this dialog box, you can indicate which dates (Early Start, Early Finish, Late Start, or Late Finish) to display in the view and whether you want to display histogram bars or cumulative S-curves. You can also indicate whether you want to display a graph only, a table only, or a combination of the two. If you display a table, you can indicate how many decimal places should be displayed.

If you are displaying histogram bars, you have the option of specifying the bar style (3-dimensional or flat). If multiple bars are displayed, you can specify their display as either side-by-side or front-to-back. If you choose to display flat bars front-to-back, Open Plan varies the width of the bars to distinguish between the different types of information being displayed.

To define risk histogram display options, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences.
   - Right-click anywhere in the view, and click Preferences on the context menu.
2. Enter the information for the display options.
3. Click OK to return to the view.

### Customizing the Date Scale

As in the case of a resource histogram, you can customize the date scale appearing in a risk histogram view using the same procedures that you use to customize the date scale in a barchart view.

> **Attention:** For information about customizing a histogram date scale, see Customizing the Date Scale.

## Customizing the Web Publisher

Each time you use the Open Plan Web Publisher to set up an HTML file that points to .pdf versions of project views, Open Plan creates a small text file, `<projectname>.wbx`, that contains the parameters for that operation. These .wbx files store information such as the project name and description as well as a listing of the contents of each batch defined for the project and the output options selected by the user.

> **Note:** Do not change the default printer during an Open Plan Web Publisher session since this may cause Open Plan to output the reports to the wrong device.

### Customizing Headers and Footers

It is possible to specify custom headers and footers for the resulting HTML file by adding [Header] and [Footer] sections to the .wbx file. You can define a custom header or footer by setting one or more options to lines of standard HTML code as in the following example:

```ini
[Header]
H1=<CENTER>This is a custom header</CENTER>
H2=<CENTER>Second line of a custom header</CENTER>
[Footer]
F1=<CENTER>This is a custom footer</CENTER>
```

> **Note:** The option names used in this example (H1, H2, and F1) are for demonstration purposes only and can, in fact, be any text string.

It is also possible to define default headers and footers for all HTML files created by your installation of Open Plan. The contents of all project-specific .wbx files can be based on the settings defined in a default .wbx file. This file must be named `Opweb.wbx` and must be located in the System folder of your Open Plan installation. If you add [Header] and [Footer] sections to this file, Open Plan automatically adds the sections to all new .wbx files created thereafter.

The following is a typical example of `Opweb.wbx`:

```ini
[DefaultBatch]
CurrentDevice=Acrobat PDFWriter
MakeHTML=1
DestinationDir=C:\OUTPUT
WebSite=/
View001=Progress Network|C:\Opp\System\Progflow.tpl|501.GIF
View002=Activity Network|C:\Opp\System\Flowvw.tpl|501.GIF
[Header]
H1=<CENTER>ABC Industries</CENTER>
[Footer]
F1=<CENTER>For Internal Distribution Only</CENTER>
```

If this file is present in the Open Plan system folder, all new batches will default to these output options and will automatically include the two views specified. In addition, a header and footer will appear in the final HTML file.

When you are launching the Open Plan Web Publisher from outside Open Plan, you can include a command line parameter that specifies a group of .wbx files and report batches to output as follows:

```
OPWPUB32.exe @<textfile>
```

The `<textfile>` parameter, in turn, refers to a file containing one or more statements that specify .wbx files and batch names using the following syntax:

```
/W=<.wbxfile> /B=<batchname>
```

For example, you might set up a command statement as follows:

```
OPWPUB32.exe @c:\Opp\Data\Mylist.txt
```

The file `Mylist.txt` might, in turn, consist of the following statements:

```
/W=C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\USERS\Proj1.wbx /B=Batch1
/W=C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\USERS\Proj1.wbx /B=Batch2
/W=C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\USERS\Proj2.wbx /B=Batch1
/W=C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\USERS\Proj2.wbx /B=Batch2
```

Invoking the Open Plan Web Publisher in this way would result in the four batches being output automatically.

# Utilities

## Open Plan Configuration Files

Settings can be configured to individual user preferences and stored in a `Config.dat` file saved in a separate folder. All users accessing the same program executable are using the same `Config.dat` file that is stored in the program folder.

Open Plan uses other .dat files that allow you to customize settings and view stored information. Tab options can be added to the `AddIns.dat` file to instruct Open Plan to launch external applications. A complete list of available data sources can be viewed in the `Datasources.dat` file. The `Briefcase.dat` file lists the data sources that are briefcased.

> **Note:** On the following pages, Location indicates where Open Plan expects to find the specific setting.

### Working with Dockable Web Windows

The Task Form and Resource Selector Add-ins, which are Open Plan Web Windows, are dockable. When the web window is docked, you can click and drag the title bar to undock the window or move the window to a new docking position.

- When you want to move the web window without snapping it into place (floating mode), you can press the Ctrl key while dragging the window.
- While the window is floating, you can return the window to its previous docked position by double-clicking the title bar.
- When you right-click the title bar of the window, the following context menu appears:

You can choose to dock or auto hide the web window. When auto hidden, you can re-launch the window by clicking the window tab located at the bottom of the screen. You also have the option to temporarily display the window by placing your mouse cursor over the same window tab.

## Sample Tools

Open Plan ships with the following programmed tools. The items in bold display on the Add-Ins tab by default. The remaining items can be enabled by uncommenting their entries in the AddIns.dat file.

- **Task Form**
- **Renumber Activities**
- **DCMA 12 VBS**
- **Options Barchart**
- **Resource Selector**
- Resource Utilization Chart
- Resource Management Wall Chart
- Date & Status Report (XML)
- Predecessor & Successor Report (XML)
- Assignment Barchart
- Resource/Activity Report (XML)
- Schedule Comparer
- Edit AddIns.dat
- Reload Add-Ins
- Sample Dialog
- Document Launcher
- Document Library Objects
- Deltek Web site
- Cobra Link
- Cobra Sync
- Parts Database
- Cobra Cost Detail

Each of these tools can be modified to create tools specific to user needs. To edit some of the tools, you will need Microsoft Visual Basic.

### Task Form

The Task Form add-in is an Open Plan Web Window that docks at the bottom of the view. It displays data about the activity selected in the view. There is a header for basic activity information a radio button to select what additional details are displayed in the bottom of the screen.

The Task Form tool is available when a project view is in focus and an activity is selected.

**Notes** display all populated note categories for the selected activity.

**Details** display predecessors and resources for the selected activity.

**Logic** displays predecessors and successors for the selected activity.

In this view controlling relationships are highlighted with a red background. Completed relationships are shown with a gray background and strikethrough text.

**Resource Summary** displays assignments for the selected activity and the project summary usage for those resources found on other project.

This can help find where critical resources are being used. You may need to negotiate for these resources with other projects.

```
String:Tool19=System:Task Form;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\OPXMLVIEW\TaskForm\oppdataFrames.htm?DOCKSIDE=BOTTOM&DOCKLENGTH=300 %P %A %V %D %I %T
```

### Renumber Activities

The Renumber Activities tool is available when an activity view is in focus and 2 or more activities are selected. It allows you to renumber the local portion of the Activity ID for selected activities using a start value and increment. It will not renumber activities that have different parents or are at different levels. It is intended for contiguous groups of activities that all have the same parent task.

When selected, you are prompted for the start value and increment. The tool will renumber the activities selected above so that they would:

| Activity ID Before | Activity ID After |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 1.1.F.01 | 1.1.F.10 |
| 1.1.F.02 | 1.1.F.20 |
| 1.1.F.03 | 1.1.F.30 |
| 1.1.F.04 | 1.1.F.40 |
| 1.1.F.05 | 1.1.F.50 |

```
String: Tool18=System:Renumber Activities;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbapps\Renumber\actrenumber.exe %P
```

### DCMA 12 VBS

The DCMA 12 VBS tool runs a VBScript file. DCMA 12 has you select an activity on the critical path. When you run the tool it adds 600 days to the activity duration and runs TA. It expects the project finish to go out by 600d if the critical path is complete. If the end does not go out about 600d then the test fails. The tool restores the duration on the selected activity and tuns TA again to reset the dates.

### Options Barchart

The Options Barchart tool uses the Configurable Options functionality to configure the appearance of the Options Barchart view on the fly.

When the tool is run for a selected open project, Open Plan displays the Options Barchart view and then displays the following check box on top of the view:

By selecting (or clearing) these check boxes, you can toggle the display of the Critical Path, Float, and Milestone Dates.

The following string enables this tool:

```
String: Tool11= System:Options Barchart;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbapps\options\options.exe "_Option_" "OptionsBarchart" %P
```

where

- `_Option_` identifies the calculated fields used by the Options Barchart tool. The names of the three calculated fields all begin with "_Option_" (for example, _Option_Highlight_Critical_Path). When displayed in the Options check box, the "_Option_" and the remaining underscores are removed.
- `OptionsBarchart` identifies the name of the activity barchart that is displayed.

### Configurable Options

The Configurable Options sample application allows you to create a custom Add-Ins tool that configures the appearance of an activity barchart view on the fly. This works by changing the value of specific calculated fields. The barchart attributes are defined to use filters that respond to changes in these calculated fields, thus changing the appearance of the barchart view.

> **Note:** For more information on the Configurable Options functionality, see Configurable Options.

To use this functionality, add the following line to the AddIns.dat file:

```
Tool#=Label;Drive:\Path\Options.exe "_Optiontag_" "Viewname" %P
```

Where

- `#` is a valid Tool number.
- `Label` is the name that is displayed on the Add-Ins tab.
- `Drive:\Path\` is the location of the Options.exe file.
- `_Optiontag_` is the string that identifies a calculated field as a configurable option.
- `Viewname` is the name of the activity barchart view that is to be displayed.

To illustrate the process for creating a Configurable Options custom tool, assume that we want to create an option to turn the display of non-critical activities for the Early Dates bar on and off for the default activity barchart view BARVW. The `_Optiontag_` we will use is "_Sample_."

> **Note:** On the Bar Sets Preferences dialog box for BARVW, notice that the Non_Critical filter is already associated with the Early Dates bar type. Instead of creating a filter, we will modify a copy of this filter.

To set up a configurable options custom tool, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new calculated field using a specific _Optiontag_ (for example, _Sample_Show_Noncritical).
2. Create the filter that will respond to the changes in the value of the above calculated field.
3. Modify the bar set preferences for the activity barchart view that will use the custom tool.
4. Add the Tool string to the AddIns.dat file.

Each of these steps is described in detail below.

#### Step One

1. On the Tools tab, click Calculated Fields.
2. On the Calculated Fields dialog box, click New.
3. On the New Calculated Field dialog box, enter the following:
   - **Name:** _Sample_Show_Noncritical
   - **Applies to Table:** Activity
   - **Data Type:** Integer
4. Click OK.
5. Enter 1 for the expression, and click OK.
6. Click Close.

> **Note:** When the option is displayed in the Options check box, the OptionTag and the remaining underscores are removed.

#### Step Two

1. On the Tools tab, click Filters.
2. Select the Non_Critical filter, and click Copy. This is the filter currently associated with the Early Dates bar type.
3. Change the filter name to _Samp_Non_Critical.
4. On the row beneath the existing parameters, add the following:
   - **Logic:** And
   - **Field Name:** _Sample_Show_Noncritical
   - **Operator:** Equals
   - **Value 1:** 1
5. Click OK twice.

> **Note:** You can name the filter anything you want.

#### Step Three

1. On the View tab, click Bar Sets.

# Utilities

## Bar Sets Configuration

2. On the Bar Sets dialog box, select BARVW_BRS, and click Edit.
3. Select the Criterion field for Early Dates.
4. Using the drop-down list, select _Samp_Non_Critical.
5. Click Ok twice.

### Step Four

1. On the Add-Ins tab, click Edit AddIns.dat.
2. When the AddIns.dat file displays, enter the following string at the end of the list:

```
Tool#=Show Non-Critical;C:\Program Files\Deltek\Open Plan Professional\Sample Tools\VBAPPS\Options\options.exe "_Sample_" "BARVW" %P
```

3. Save and Close the modified file.
4. On the Add-Ins tab, click Reload Add-Ins to initialize the new tool without having to restart Open Plan.

When you run the Show Non-Critical tool for a selected open project, Open Plan automatically displays the BARVW view with the Options check box on top showing the option you created.

> **Note:** Substitute the # with the next Tool number available.

## Resource Selector

When launched, this Web Window builds a hierarchical tree of the resources assigned to the current project. You can then use the tree to filter a barchart view to show the activities using the selected resource. It also displays the selected resource in the histogram.

**String:**
```
Tool17=Resource:Resource Selector;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\OPXMLview\XMLResSel\ResSelFrame.htm %d %P %V
```

## Resource Utilization Chart

The Resource Utilization Chart tool allows you to view crosstable information dynamically rather than in a text file with the Crosstab Export tool. After selecting a resource within a resource view, run the Resource Utilization Chart tool. The following is displayed with a table containing resource usage information for the resource selected.

You can change the type of data displayed by right-clicking the screen and selecting your options.

**String:**
```
Tool5=Resource Utilization Chart;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\OPXMLview\crosstab\crosstab.htm %i %R %r
```

## Resource Management Wall Chart

The Resource Management Wall Chart tool is similar to the Open Plan histogram view showing the loading of various resources. While a histogram view gives detail loading information, it is not easy to see the loading of multiple resources on a single page.

Each resource is listed on a single line on the chart. Against each resource are a series of colored blocks representing the following:

- **Grey** â non-working time (for that resource)
- **Blue** â the resource is used (somewhere between 0 and 100% of availability)
- **Red** â the resource is overloaded

**String:**
```
Tool9=Resource:Resource Management Wall Chart;%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\OPXMLview\wallchart\wallchart.htm %i %R %T
```

## Date & Status Report (XML)

The Date & Status Report (XML) tool allows you to view dates and statuses of a project's activities in a summarized table. The information is displayed in XML format allowing more functionality and a user-friendly appearance. To use the tool, first select a project and then run the Date & Status Report (XML) tool.

**String:**
```
Tool6=XML Views:Date && Status Report;wscript.exe "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\RunXMLReport.vbs" "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\actdata2.lst" /D %P
```

## Predecessor & Successor Report (XML)

The Predecessor & Successor Report (XML) tool allows you to view a table showing the relationships between the activities within a project. Information in the table includes relationship lag, activity descriptions, durations, early start and finish dates, and late start and finish dates. To use the tool, first select a project and then run the Predecessor & Successor Report (XML) tool.

**String:**
```
Tool7=XML Views:Predecessor && Successor Report;wscript.exe "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\RunXMLReport.vbs" "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\actdata1.lst" /D %P
```

## Assignment Barchart

The Assignment Barchart tool displays a view showing each resource and its assigned activity ID along with bars indicating when the resource is being used. This allows users to see the allocation of resources to activities in one view.

**String:**
```
Tool10=XML Views:Assignment Barchart;wscript.exe "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\asgbar.vbs" %P %R
```

## Resource/Activity Report (XML)

The Resource/Activity Report (XML) tool provides you with a breakdown of a project's resources and the activities that use those resources. To use the tool, first select a project and then run the Resource/Activity Report (XML) tool.

**String:**
```
Tool8=XML Views:Resource/Activity Report;wscript.exe "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\RunXMLReport.vbs" "%SYSTEMDIR%\Sample Tools\vbscript\rdsdata.lst" /D %P
```

## Schedule Comparer

The Schedule Comparer allows you to compare two copies of a schedule or two baselines on a project. You can select which fields are compared.

## Edit AddIns.dat

The Edit AddIns.Dat tool opens the AddIns.dat file in a text editor. This allows you to customize tools within the Add-Ins tab.

You can create new tools, edit existing tools, or delete tools within this text document. You need to save the changes to the file and click the Reload Add-Ins to view the changes you made.

You can add up to 30 custom tools to the Add-Ins tab in Open Plan by modifying the AddIns.dat files. For example, you can add an item to the Add-Ins tab that will start the WordPad program supplied by Windows. By making the required modification to the copy of the AddIns.dat located in the executable folder, all users of the same Open Plan installation can access this tab item.

You can also add an item to the Add-Ins tab that will start Outlook. Since your copy of Outlook may contain confidential information, you would make the required modifications to the AddIns.dat located in your Open Plan User folder.

**String:**
```
Tool14=Edit AddIns.Dat;notepad.exe %SYSTEMDIR%\addins.dat
```

## Reload Add-Ins

Click the Reload Add-Ins tool to reload all of the add-ins from the AddIns.dat file.

The Briefcase.dat file specifies a user-specific briefcase data source. Briefcasing data sources cannot be shared by multiple users. The Briefcase.dat file resides in the folder specified by the UserDir setting in the Windows Registry.

## Spread Curve Profiles

In Open Plan, resource and cost assignment profiles can be defined by spread curves that describe how the assignment is spread through the duration of an activity. Open Plan provides the following standard profiles:

- Back load (B)
- Double peak (D)
- Early peak (E)
- Front load (F)
- Late peak (L)
- Bell (Normal) (N)
- Linear (T)

All assignment profiles are described by defining values for 10 evenly spaced percentile points, which are then mapped to the activity duration. The following sections discuss each of these assignment profiles in more detail.

### Back Load Profile

The back load assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated toward the end of the activity duration. The curve code for a back load assignment profile is B.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 5    | 5    | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 100
| 5    | 10   | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 70 | 100 |

### Double Peak Profile

The double peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated to two peaks â one near the beginning of the activity duration, and one near the end. The curve code for a double peak assignment profile is D.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 5    | 5    | 10 | 20 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 10 | 5 | 100
| 5    | 15   | 15 | 35 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 65 | 85 | 95 | 100 |

### Early Peak Profile

The early peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated near the beginning of the activity duration. The curve code for an early peak assignment profile is E.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 5    | 5    | 15 | 25 | 20 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 100
| 5    | 20   | 20 | 45 | 65 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 |

### Front Load Profile

The front load assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated at the beginning of the activity duration. The curve code for a front load assignment profile is F.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 30   | 30   | 20 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 100
| 30   | 50   | 50 | 60 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 |

### Late Peak Profile

The late peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated near the end of the activity duration. The curve code for a late peak assignment profile is L.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----

| 5    | 10   | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 50 | 75 | 90 | 100 |

### Bell (Normal) Profile

The bell (normal) assignment profile describes an assignment in which a large proportion of the resource effort is allocated near the middle of the activity duration. The resource effort starts with a minimal effort, gradually increases to the middle of the duration, and then tapers off toward the end. The curve code for a bell (normal) assignment profile is N.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 5    | 5    | 5 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 100
| 5    | 10   | 10 | 20 | 30 | 50 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 95 | 100 |

### Linear Profile

The linear assignment profile describes an assignment in which the resource effort is allocated as evenly as possible throughout the activity duration. The curve code for a linear assignment profile is T.

| Inc. | Cum. | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|------|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
| 10   | 10   | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 100
| 10   | 20   | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |

## Date Formats in Open Plan

In Open Plan, you can manually define date formats using the Date Scale Preferences dialog box when:

- You define the date scale in a barchart view
- You define the date scale in a resource or risk histogram view
- You format dates using the DATEFORMAT() function in a calculated field or global edit expression.

You can also define date formats from an examples list on the Preferences tab of the Project Properties dialog box.

> **Note:** For more information on date formats, see the Date Scale Preferences Dialog Box topic (Views and Reports Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes) and the Preferences Tab topic (Working with Projects Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Project Properties Dialog Box) in the Open Plan online help.

### Defining Date Formats

You can specify the appearance of a date format using one or more of the following parameters:

| Parameter | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| %T | Minute | 15 |
| %H | Hour | 8 |
| %Z | AM or PM | AM or PM |
| %OZ | AM or PM (lower case) | am or pm |
| %D | Day of the month | 31 |
| %V | Day | Tuesday |
| %OV | Day (lower case) | Tuesday |
| %UV | Day (upper case) | TUESDAY |
| %W | Day abbreviation | Tues |
| %OW | Day abbreviation (lower case) | tues |
| %UW | Day abbreviation (upper case) | TUES |
| %F | Single character day | T |
| %OF | Single character day (lower case) | t |
| %K | Week number | 22 |
| %M | Numeric month | 10 |
| %L | Month | October |
| %OL | Month (lower case) | october |
| %UL | Month (upper case) | OCTOBER |
| %A | Month abbreviation | Oct |
| %OA | Month abbreviation (lower case) | oct |
| %UA | Month abbreviation (upper case) | OCT |
| %S | Single character month | O |
| %OS | Single character month (lower case) | o |
| %Q | Numeric quarter | 4 |
| %C | Year | 2003 |
| %Y | Two-digit year | 03 |

You can combine parameters to define date formats. You can also include spaces and literal characters in the format, as shown in the following examples:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| %H:%T %Z | 07:15 PM |
| %W %D %A %H:%T | Mon 13 Sep 19:15 |
| %M/%D/%C | 09/13/2003 |
| Q%Q | Q1 |

To display relative dates in a barchart or histogram date scale, use the following parameters:

| Parameter | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| %R%H | Relative hours |
| %R%D | Relative days |
| %R%K | Relative weeks |
| %R%M | Relative months |
| %R%Q | Relative quarters |
| %R%Y | Relative years |

> **Note:** In Open Plan, hours and minutes default to the 24-hour (military) convention. The %Z or the %OZ parameter in the definition of the format changes hours and minutes to the standard time format.

> **Note:** In barchart and histogram views, the values displayed for dates using a relative format are based on the Reference Date setting on the Manual tab of the Date Scale Preferences dialog box. To have Open Plan convert the currently selected date format to a relative date format, select the Relative to Reference Date option from the Date Formats dialog box.

All of these different types of format parameters can be combined with literal characters to produce the following types of labels:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| %R%H Hours | 100 Hours |
| Day %R%D | Day 3 |
| Week %R%K | Week 15 |
| FY%R%Y | FY3 |

## Project Utilities

Open Plan includes a number of project-level utilities that facilitate the manipulation of project data. These include:

- Filters
- Sorts
- Calculated Fields
- Global Edits
- User Defined Fields
- User Defined Validations
- Spread curves

## Filters

Filters limit the display of items in a view based on a specific criterion. For example, you may wish to display a view that shows only activities requiring a particular resource. Open Plan provides a number of predefined filters common to many project management reports. In addition to these predefined filters, you can define custom filters of your own.

When applying a filter to a view, keep the following points in mind:

- When selecting filtered activities, the status of the parent item determines the status of the child. For example, assume that you apply a filter to a view and then select a parent activity or resource pool. This selects all children of the item, even if they do not meet the original filter criteria.

- If you apply a filter to a spreadsheet or barchart view with outlining turned on, the status of child items is determined by the status of the parent when you select the Filter from the Top Down option. For example, if a parent activity fails to meet the criteria of a filter, none of that parent's children will appear in the view, even in cases where the individual child activities satisfy the filter.

- If you apply a filter to a linked spreadsheet view, the filter applies only to information from the primary data table for the view.

> **Attention:** For information about outlining and linking in spreadsheets, see Views and Reports Â» Spreadsheet Views in the Open Plan online help.

### Using Filters

To display a list of available filters, on the Tools tab click the Filters Â» Manage Filters. Open Plan responds by displaying the following dialog box:

Each view for a project can have a different filter in effect. The name of the filter currently in effect appears in the status bar at the bottom of the Open Plan window.

To reapply the filter (or the sort) without exiting the view, click the Refresh button on the toolbar.

Once a filter is in effect for a view, you can continue to add items to the view. Open Plan displays the items as you add them, even if the new items do not satisfy the current filter condition. However, if you refresh the view or close the view and return to it later, the items you added may not be displayed if the filter expression excludes them.

To apply a filter in a network view, you must use the Placements command.

> **Attention:** For more information on applying a filter in a network view, see Views and Reports Â» Network View in the Open Plan online help.

To apply a filter, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click Filters
   - On the Edit tab, click Filters.
   - Right-click within the view, and click Filters on the context menu.
   - Double click the current filter (or No Filter) name in the status bar.
2. From the Filters dialog box, select the filter you want to apply.
3. Click OK.

To refresh a filter, complete the following steps:

1. On the toolbar, click the Refresh button.

To cancel a filter, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click Filters
   - On the Edit tab, click Filters.
   - Right-click within the view, and click Filters on the context menu.
   - Double click the current filter (or No Filter) name in the status bar.
2. From the Filters dialog box, select <Cancel filter>, and click OK.

### Defining Filter Expressions

Open Plan allows you to define custom filter expressions that can be applied to views of project information. These custom expressions can be based on any field from the activity- or resource-related data tables and can feature complex expressions using logical operators and parentheses. Once you create a filter, you can make that filter available to other users in the network.

In addition to their use as view filters, filter expressions can appear as criteria for bar attributes in a barchart view or for box attributes in a network view.

When you create a new filter, Open Plan displays a dialog box in which you can enter a filter name and indicate the source of the fields to appear in the filter.

Once you have entered a name and a data table for the filter, Open Plan allows you to enter the expression for the filter criterion using the following dialog box:

With this dialog box, you can build a filter using the following components:

**Logic** â You can build complex filter expressions using the following logical operators:
- AND
- AND NOT
- OR

**Field Name** â Filter expressions can include any field from the selected data table, including calculated fields and any filters already defined for that table. Previously defined filters specified as fields can have one of two values: true or false.

> **Attention:** For information about calculated fields, see Defining Calculated Fields.

**Operator** â Filter expressions can contain any of the following operators:
- Between
- Contains (This operator is case-sensitive. Criteria entered using this expression must be typed in the same case as the original value. If the same case is not used, no results will be displayed.)
- Equals
- Greater or Equals
- Greater Than
- Is Empty (available for text fields only)
- Less or Equals
- Less Than
- Not Between
- Not Contains
- Not Empty (available for text fields only)
- Not Equals

**Value 1** â The values available for a filter expression depend on the type of field used in the expression. For example:

- If you select a text, numeric, or date field, Open Plan allows you to select another field from the table (including calculated fields and previously defined filters), or you can enter a text, numeric, or date constant.

If you are defining a filter that includes an activity or resource ID, make sure that you enter the value using upper-case characters.

- If you select an enumerated field for the expression, Open Plan displays a list of valid choices from which you must select. For example, the Activity Type field is an enumerated field with valid values such as ASAP, ALAP, or Start Milestone.

- If you select a logical field for the expression, Open Plan allows you to select either true or false as a value.

**Value 2** â If the expression uses either the Between or Not Between operators, you can enter a second value for the filter.

**Share this Item with Others** â This option allows you to permit other users to use the filter that you are creating. This option is enabled only for permanent filters that you create. You cannot share a temporary filter.

This setting is useful, for example, for managers who want to create a filter that they do not want others to have access to.

**Insert Parentheses** â You can insert a left and right parenthesis in any expression. Left parentheses can be inserted at the beginning of the Field column; right parentheses can be inserted at the end of a row in the Value 2 setting. Parentheses allow you to develop complex expressions such as the following examples:

- C1 Equals "1.1" AND (C2 Equals "QA" OR C2 Equals "Pubs")
- (C1 Equals "1.1" AND C2 Equals "QA") OR C2 Equals "Pubs"

When you click More, the Filter Expression dialog box extends to display additional controls:

**Expression** â This field reflects the actual expression that is displayed in the grid. If you prefer, you can enter the filter expression directly in the text box.

**Fields** â Clicking this button displays the Fields dialog box. You can use this dialog box to select fields to include in the filter expression.

**Functions** â Clicking this button displays the Functions dialog box. You can use this dialog box to select functions to use in the filter expression.

**Validate** â When you have created a filter expression, you can click this button to have Open Plan validate the expression. If the filter expression is valid, Open Plan populates the grid with the appropriate values.

**Less** â Clicking this button hides the dialog box extension.

To add a filter expression, complete the following steps:

1. Take any of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click Filters Â» select a filter, then click New.
   - On the Edit tab, click Filters Â» select a filter, then click New.
   - Right-click within the view, and click Filters on the context menu Â» select a filter, then click New.
   - On the Edit tab, click Edit Filter.
2. In the New Filter dialog box, enter a name, and select a source data table for the new filter.

   - Right-click within the view, and click Filters on the context menu, Â» select a filter, then click Delete.
2. When Open Plan asks you to confirm the deletion, click Yes.

### Additional Filtering Options

The following options are also available for filtering:

**Add to Filter** â This option takes a selection range and adds the selection values to the currently selected filter based on the following rules:
- Multiple selections within a column are added to the filter with an OR EQUALS condition
- Multiple selections across columns are added to the filter with an AND EQUALS condition

**Remove from Filter** â This option takes a selection range and adds the selection values to the currently selected filter based on the following rules:
- Multiple selections within a column are added to the filter with an OR NOT EQUALS condition
- Multiple selections across columns are added to the filter with an AND NOT EQUALS condition

**Clear Filter** â This option removes the currently selected filter. It is equivalent to displaying the Manage Filters dialog box and choosing Cancel Filter.

**Toggle Filter** â Once a filter has been applied, this option turns the filter on or off while still remembering it.

**Edit Expression** â This option displays the Filter Expression dialog box while bypassing the Manage Filters dialog box.

**Reapply Filter/Sort** â Select this option to apply the last filter and sort again.

To apply one of these options, complete the following steps:

1. On the Edit tab, click Add to Filter.

### Temporary Filters

In addition to creating permanent filters, you can also create temporary filters. Temporary filters are available only in the view in which they are defined and valid until superseded by another filter. You cannot make these temporary filters available to other projects, nor can you make them available to other users with the Share this Item with Others option.

Temporary filters can be created in two ways:

**By selecting <Temporary Filter> on the Filters dialog box**
Creating a temporary filter in this manner uses the same Filter Expression dialog box used for creating a new filter but with two exceptions: the name of the filter is <temporary> and the Share this Item with Others option is disabled.

**By typing the temporary filter expression directly in the field where it will be used.**
For example, you can type the temporary filter expression directly into the Criterion field on the Bar Attributes tab of:
- The Bar Set Preferences dialog box
- The Network View Preferences dialog box

The manner in which the Filter Expression dialog box for a temporary filter is displayed depends on the view from which it is accessed:

- In network views, you can display the Filter Expression dialog box for a temporary filter by clicking Filters on the Placements dialog box and then selecting <Temporary Filter> from the Filters dialog box.

- In spreadsheet and barchart views, you can display the Filter Expression dialog box for a temporary filter by clicking Filters on the Tools tab and then selecting <Temporary Filter> from the Filters dialog box.

The temporary filter created in this manner can be applied only to a primary table. In multi-table views, you can apply a filter to a secondary table using the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box.

To define a temporary filter using the Filter Expression dialog box:

1. Display the view in which you want to apply the temporary filter.
2. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click Filters
   - On the Edit tab, click Filters.
   - Right-click within the view, and click Filters on the context menu.
   - On the Tools tab, click Filters.

Open Plan displays the Filters dialog box.

3. Take one of the following actions:
   - Select <Temporary Filter>, and click Edit.
   - Double-click <Temporary Filter>.
4. In the Filter Expression dialog box, define the temporary filter in the grid.

Click More to expand the Filter Expression dialog box if you want to use the Fields and Functions buttons as an aid in building your filter expressions.

5. Click OK.

To define a temporary filter in a Network view, complete the following steps:

1. On the View tab, click Placements.
2. On the Placements dialog box, click the Filters button to display the Filters dialog box.
3. Take one of the following actions:
   - Select <Temporary Filter>, and click Edit.
   - Double-click <Temporary Filter>.
4. In the Filter Expression dialog box, define the temporary filter in the grid.

Click More to expand the Filter Expression dialog box if you want to use the Fields and Functions buttons as an aid in building your filter expressions.

5. Click OK.

### Temporary Filters on a Secondary Table

You can apply a temporary filter to a secondary table in a multi-table view by using the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box:

The filter for data from all subsidiary tables is controlled independently, so a new filter on a subsidiary table is in addition to a filter on a higher level.

If you inadvertently enter the filter expression on the wrong row, Open Plan attempts to automatically move the filter expression to the correct row. This will be visible the next time that you display the Define Link tab.

To define a temporary filter on a secondary table in a multi-table view, complete the following steps:

1. Open the multi-table view to which you want to apply a temporary filter.
2. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences.
   - Right-click within the view, and click Preferences on the context menu.

Open Plan displays the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box.

3. Click the Define Link tab.
4. In the Filter field, enter the temporary filter you want to apply, and click OK.

Open Plan applies the filter to the secondary table identified in the table column.

These temporary filters are not displayed in the Filters dialog box. They are not saved as part of the project. If you save a view while a temporary filter is in effect, Open Plan saves the view with the filter applied.

In addition to using temporary filters in Open Plan views, you can create and use temporary filters in the following circumstances:

- Export scripts
- OLE automation

## Sorts

By default, Open Plan displays activities and resources in barchart and spreadsheet views in order of ID. However, you can assign a different sorting sequence to a view so that, for example, activities appear in order of early start dates.

Open Plan provides a number of predefined sorts that are commonly used in project management reports. In addition to these predefined sorts, you can define custom sorts of your own.

If a view is displayed using outlining or groupings, Open Plan sorts the items within the outline or grouping hierarchy.

### Default Sort Order Rules

The following rules apply to the default sort order, which is in effect when there is no sort specified. Explicitly sorting on Activity ID will still sort alphabetically.

- The default sort order for all hierarchical fields (activity IDs, resource IDs, and codes) is interpreted numerically, if possible. Therefore, "1.2" is sorted before "1.10." Character data is sorted alphabetically.

- Mixed character and numeric data is also sorted alphabetically, except that any trailing numeric digits are sorted numerically. For example, "A2" comes before "A10." Since each component of the name is sorted independently, some data can be numeric and some not.

- IDs with leading zeros are sorted first. For example, "A01" comes before "A1."

Also, when you have a table based upon a hierarchy, the Refresh button on the toolbar is enabled even when no sort or filter is specified.

The rules for the sort order are fundamental to the workings of the automatic numbering and indent/outdent features.

> **Attention:** For information on automatic numbering and the indent/outdent features, see Views and Reports Â» Spreadsheet View in the Open Plan online help.

### Using Sorts

Issuing the Sorts command displays a list of available sorts in the Sorts dialog box:

# Utilities

## Applying Sorts

You can use this dialog box to apply an existing sort to the view as well as to cancel the sort currently in effect.

Each view for a project can have a different sort in effect. The name of the sort currently in effect appears in the status bar at the bottom of the Open Plan window.

To reapply the sort (or the filter) without exiting the view, click the **Reapply Filter And Sort** button on the toolbar.

### To apply a sort, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.
   - Double click the current sort (or No Sort) name in the status bar.

2. From the Sorts dialog box, select the sort you want to apply, and click **Close**.

### To refresh a sort, complete the following steps:

On the Edit tab, click the **Reapply Filter And Sort** button.

### To cancel a sort, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.
   - Double click the current sort (or No Sort) name in the status bar.

2. From the Sorts dialog box, select **<Cancel sort>**, and click **Close**.

## Defining Custom Sorts

You can define custom sort sequences based on data from any activity- or resource-related data table. Custom sorts can also include any calculated fields for those tables.

When you create a new sort, Open Plan displays a dialog box in which you can enter a sort name and indicate the source of the sort fields.

> **Note:** Sorts do not affect the display of activities in a network view.

Once you have entered a name and selected a data table, Open Plan allows you to define the sort expression using the following dialog box.

With this dialog box, you can build a sort expression by indicating each sorting field and whether Open Plan should use an ascending or a descending order when sorting activities using that field. You can also choose to share this item with others.

You can define sort expressions based on substrings of a text field (for example, the activity description) by creating a calculated field containing the substring and then including the calculated field in the sort expression.

> **Attention:** For information about creating calculated fields, see Defining Calculated Fields.

### To add a sort, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.

2. On the Sorts dialog box, click **New**.

3. In the New Sort dialog box, enter a name, and select a source data table for the new sort expression.

4. Click **OK**.

5. In the Sort Expression dialog box, define the sort expression.

6. When the information for the expression is complete, click **OK** to return to the Sorts dialog box.

### To edit a sort, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.

2. From the Sorts dialog box, select the sort you want to change, and click **Edit**.

3. In the Sort Expression dialog box, update the sort expression.

4. When the information for the expression is complete, click **OK** to return to the Sorts dialog box.

   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.

2. From the Sorts dialog box, select the sort you want to copy, and click **Copy**.

3. In the Sort Expression dialog box, enter a new name for the sort.

4. When the information for the new expression is complete, click **OK** to return to the Sorts dialog box.

### To delete a sort, complete the following steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.

2. From the Sorts dialog box, select the sort you want to delete, and click **Delete**.

3. When Open Plan asks you to confirm the deletion, click **Yes**.

## Temporary Sorts

In addition to creating permanent sorts, you can also create temporary sorts. Temporary sorts are available only in the view in which they are defined and valid until they are superceded by another sort. You cannot make these temporary filters available to other projects or users.

You can create temporary sorts in the following ways:

- By clicking the column headings in a spreadsheet view if the Click to Sort option is enabled. Using this method you can sort the data in the spreadsheet based on either a single column or on multiple columns.
- By selecting **<Temporary Sort>** from the Sorts dialog box to display the Temporary Sort Expression dialog box.

The temporary sort created in the two manners described above can be applied to a primary table. In a multi-table spreadsheet view, you have the option of applying a sort to a secondary table using the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box or by clicking the column headings as described above.

> **Attention:** For more information on the Click to Sort option, see Click to Sort.

In a multi-table view, the primary table is the main table upon which the view is based. The secondary table is the linked table.

While you can simply type the sort expression in the text box of the Temporary Sort Expression dialog box, you can also use the Fields and Functions buttons to display dialog boxes that you can use as an aid in building the sort expression.

### Sort Expression Syntax

Open Plan temporary sorts are formed using the following syntax:

```
<sort_field1>,<sort order>|<sort_field2>,<sort order>|â¦
```

where:
- Each of the `<sort_fieldx>` values is either the name of an existing field on the appropriate table or the definition of a calculated field for that table.
- The `<sort order>` indicates an ascending (0) or a descending (1) sort.
- The piping symbol (|) separates the sorts you create.

For example, the following expression:

```
ORIG_DUR,0|ACT_ID,1
```

Would first sort ascending the original duration field and then within that would sort descending the activity ID field.

In addition to using temporary sorts in Open Plan views, you can also use temporary sorts in the following circumstances:
- Export scripts
- OLE automation

### To define a temporary sort using the Temporary Sort Expression dialog box, complete the following steps:

1. Display the view to which you want to apply the temporary sort.

2. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the Tools tab, click **Sorts**.
   - Right-click within the view, and click **Sorts** on the context menu.
   - On the Edit tab, click **Manage** from the Sorts group.

   Open Plan displays the Sorts dialog box.

3. Display the Temporary Sort Expression dialog box by taking one of the following actions:
   - Double-click **<Temporary Sort>**.
   - Select **<Temporary Sort>**, and click **Edit**.

4. Enter the temporary sort in the text box.
   You can use the Fields and Functions buttons as an aid in building your sort expressions.

5. Click **OK**.

## Temporary Sort on a Secondary Table

You can apply a temporary sort to a secondary table in the multi-table spreadsheet view by using the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box:

- The sort order for data from all subsidiary tables is controlled independently, so a new sort on a subsidiary table is in addition to a sort on a higher level.
- If you inadvertently enter the sort expression on the wrong row, Open Plan attempts to automatically move the sort expression to the correct row. This will be visible the next time that you display the Define Link tab.

> **Note:** You can also create a temporary sort for a secondary table by applying the Click to Sort feature to column headings of the secondary table. For more information, see Click to Sort.

> **Note:** When you sort columns based on a secondary table, using the Click to Sort option records the temporary sort in the Sort column of the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box.

### To define a temporary sort on a secondary table in a multi-table view, complete the following steps:

1. Open the multi-table spreadsheet view to which you want to apply a temporary sort.

2. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click **Preferences**.
   - Right-click an empty area of the view, and click **Preferences** on the context menu.

3. On the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box, click the **Define Link** tab.

4. In the Sorts field, enter the temporary sort you want to apply, and click **OK**.

Open Plan applies the sort to the secondary table identified in the To Table column.

These temporary sorts are not displayed in the Sorts dialog box. They are not saved as part of the project. If you save the view while a temporary sort is in effect, Open Plan saves the view with the sort applied.

## Click to Sort

In addition to the temporary sort, the spreadsheet and barchart views allow column sorting by clicking the column headings.

With the Click to Sort option enabled, you can click the column heading on which you want to base the sort. Clicking the same column heading again will toggle the sort operation between ascending and descending order.

To sort the data based on multiple columns, click the first column heading on which you want to sort. For non-adjacent columns, Ctrl-click additional columns until you have defined the entire sort expression. For adjacent columns, Shift-click additional columns until you have defined the entire sort expression.

When you sort columns based on a primary table in multi-table views, using the Click to Sort option records the temporary sort on the Temporary Sort Expression dialog box. If you sort the spreadsheet based on a secondary table, the sort expression is reflected in the Sort column on the Define Link tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box.

### To enable the Click to Sort option, complete the following steps:

Take one of the following actions:
- Right-click a column heading, and click **Click to Sort** on the context menu.
- On the View tab, click **Click to Sort**.

### To disable the Click to Sort option, complete the following steps:

Take one of the following actions:
- Right-click a column heading, and click the **Click to Sort** option on the context menu to clear it.
- On the View tab, click **Click to Sort**.

## Rollups

The Rollup utility provides the ability to perform a roll-up of date and numeric fields selected by the user. Rollups may be defined for Activities, Resources, and Codes.

Selecting Rollups from the Tools tab displays the following dialog box:

This dialog box allows you to perform a rollup of selected numeric and date fields for Activities, Resources, and Codes. For numeric fields, the parent object is the sum of its children. For date fields, the Start date of the parent object is the earliest date of its children, and the Finish date is the latest date of its children.

- The **Display for** field allows you to select the table that contains the rollup definition you want to use. When a table is selected, the dialog box is populated with all of the rollup definitions that have been created for that table. Selecting a rollup definition and clicking Apply performs the rollup for the current file.

For numeric fields, the parent object is the sum of its children. For date fields, the Start date of the parent object is the earliest date of its children, and the Finish date is the latest date of its children.

If any of the children have a blank finish date, a blank finish date is rolled up to the parent.

> **Note:** If any of the children have a blank finish date, a blank finish date is rolled up to the parent.

When you click New or select a rollup definition and click Copy or Edit, the Rollup Definition dialog box is displayed:

The Rollup Definition dialog box displays the following controls:

- **Name** â If you are creating a new definition, this field will display blank, allowing you to add a name. If you are copying an existing definition, this field will be populated with the name, preceded by copy_name. You can either accept the new name or replace it with a different name. If you are editing a definition, the name will display dimmed, and cannot be changed.

- **Applies to Table** â This field is populated with the table name that was previously selected, and cannot be changed on this dialog box.

- **Available Fields (left box)** â This lists all date and numeric fields created for the selected table. To apply a field to the rollup you are defining, double-click the edit name or click the > button to move the listed edit to the Assigned Fields window.

- **Assigned Fields (right box)** â This lists the fields the rollup definition will use. You can also remove any or all of the items in the Assigned Fields list by either double-clicking the item name, or clicking it to highlight and then clicking the < button. This will move the selected item or items to the Available Fields list.

- **Share this Item with Others** â By default, a rollup definition is only accessible to the user who creates it. By clicking the Share this Item with Others option, it can be made available to other users.

> **Note:** To move the entire list, select the list by clicking the first name, then depress the Shift key and click the last name in the list, then click the > button. To select a random group from the list to move, press and hold the CTRL key and click the mouse pointer on the items to be moved to highlight, then click the > button.

After you have created or edited rollup definitions, the display returns to the Rollups dialog box.

### To execute a rollup for the current file, complete the following steps:

1. Select a rollup definition from the Rollups dialog box.
2. Click **Apply**.

## Group Process Rollups

You can also perform a rollup in Batch Mode. This allows you to use a rollup definition for multiple projects at one time. To use a rollup definition in Batch Mode, select more than one project from the Details pane of the Open Plan Explorer, and click Rollups on the Tools tab. The Rollups [Batch Mode] dialog box will be displayed. Select the rollup definition to use, and click Apply.

If a project is closed, Open Plan will open it in Exclusive mode, perform the process, save the changes, and then close the project. If a project cannot be opened in Exclusive mode (because another user has it open in Exclusive or Shared mode), it will be skipped.

If you have a project open when the batch process is run, rollup will be performed on the project, but the changes will not be saved and the project will remain open. You must manually save the changes yourself.

## Global Edits

With the Global Edits utility, you can modify multiple activity, resource description, or resource assignment records with a single operation. Using the global edit utility you can, for example, increase all the durations in a project by 25% or change all the assignments for a specific resource. Global edit operations can modify all the records in a file or selected records based on a filter expression.

When you click Global Edits on the Tools tab, Open Plan responds with the following dialog box:

This dialog box displays a list of currently available global edits. Since they change all instances of the data, global edits may be applied regardless of whether or not any specific view is open.

The **Display For** field contains a list that segregates the global edits by type of data. For example, if you select Project from the list, the global edits that are displayed are project related.

### To apply a global edit, complete the following steps:

1. Open the project or resource file to which you want to apply the global edit.
2. On the Tools tab, click **Global Edits**.
3. Select the global edit you want to apply.
   To display the expression for the edit, click **Edit**.
4. Click **Apply**.

## Defining Global Edits

You can define global edits for both project and resource files. By default, Open Plan stores the edit expression with the project or resource file that is open when you define the field. When you define a new global edit, Open Plan displays the following dialog box:

You can use the following controls to define the global edit:

- **Name** â If you have a project or resource file open, the default value in this field is `<temporary>`. By leaving this default value, you can create global edits without saving them.

  If you have accessed this dialog box without first opening a project or resource file, the Name field is blank since there is no target for a temporary sort.

> **Warning:** In order to save a global edit, you must change the default `<temporary>` value to a different name. When you then save the global edit, the name you entered is displayed on the Global Edits dialog box.

- **Applies to Table** â Controls the data table to which the new global edit applies. The choices from which you can select depend on whether you are creating a global edit for a project or for a resource file:

| Project | Resource |
|---------|----------|
| Activity | Resource Availability |
| Relationship | Resource Description |
| Resource Assignment | Resource Escalation |
| Resource Cost | Summary Usage |
| Resource Usage | |
| Risk Detail | |
| Subproject | |

- **Replace Values in** â Controls the field of the data table to which the global edit applies.

- **Of Type** â Displays which of the following types of data is stored in the selected field of the data table:
  - Date
  - Decimal
  - Duration
  - Finish Date
  - Integer
  - Character
  - Logical
  - Enumerated values

- **With Expression** â Controls the expression that will replace the data in the selected data table field. The expression must create data of the same type as the data it will replace. For example, if the global edit replaces a date, the global expression must also create a date.

An expression defining a global edit can include the following elements:
- Character operators
- Constants
- Duration operators
- Field names
- Functions
- Logical operators
- Mathematical operators
- Calculated fields
- Relational operators

- **Matching Filter** â The ellipsis button at the right edge of this field displays the Filters dialog box that you can use to apply a filter to the global edit. In this way, you can limit the records that will be affected by the global edit.

- **Fields** â Displays a dialog box where you can select a field to include in the expression.

- **Functions** â Displays a list of available functions.

- **Values** â Displays the Select a Value dialog box that you can use to select a value to include in the global edit.

The expression for a global edit can use the same set of functions, operators, and field names that you use when creating calculated fields.

The following table shows some simple examples of operations you can perform on the original durations of activities in a project:

| Expression | Result |
|------------|--------|
| ORIG_DUR-\|1d\| | Subtract one day from each duration |
| ORIG_DUR*1.25 | Increase durations by 25% |
| SCHED_DUR | Set original durations to scheduled durations |

You can also specify a filter to limit the effect of the operation to a selected group of records.

### To add a global edit, complete the following steps:

1. On the Tools tab, click **Global Edits**.
2. On the Global Edits dialog box, click **New**.
3. Enter the following information for the operation:
   - The name of the edit
   - The data table and field to modify
   - The expression for the operation
   - An optional filter for the operation

   To see a list of fields for the expression, click **Fields**.
   To see a list of functions for the expression, click **Functions**.

4. When the definition is complete, click **OK** to return to the Global Edits dialog box.

To create a new filter for the edit from the Global Edit Definition dialog box, click the ellipsis button displayed next to the filter text box. For information about creating a filter, see Defining Filter Expressions.

### To apply a global edit without saving the expression, complete the following steps:

1. Open the project or resource file for which you want to apply the temporary global edit.
2. On the Tools tab, click **Global Edits**.
3. On the Global Edits dialog box, click **New**.
4. Enter the information for the expression, but leave the name as `<temporary>`.
5. When the expression is complete, click **Apply**.

4. When the information for the new edit is complete, click **OK** to return to the Global Edits dialog box.

### To delete a global edit, complete the following steps:

1. On the Tools tab, click **Global Edits**.
2. Select the global edit you want to delete, and click **Delete**.
3. When Open Plan asks you to confirm the deletion, click **Yes**.

## Batch Global Edits

A global edit allows you to modify multiple activities or resources with a single operation. The Batch Global Edits dialog box allows you to create groups of global edits (batches) that can be applied to a file in a single operation. When you click Batch Global Edits on the Tools tab, Open Plan responds with the following dialog box:

The Batch Global Edits dialog box displays a list of currently available definitions. The **Display For** field contains a list that segregates the batches by type of data. For example, if you select Activity from the list, the batches that are displayed are activity related.

When you click New or select a batch and click Copy or Edit, the Batch Global Edit Definition dialog box is displayed:

You can use this dialog box to select the global edits that the batch will use as well as the order in which the global edits are executed.

The Batch Global Edit Definition dialog box displays the following controls:

- **Name** â If you are creating a new definition, this field will display blank, allowing you to add a name. If you are copying an existing definition, this field will be populated with the name, preceded by copy_name of edit. You can either accept the new name or replace it with a different name. If you are editing a definition, the name will display dimmed, and cannot be changed.

- **Applies to Table** â This field is populated with the table name that was previously selected, and cannot be changed on this dialog box.

- **Available Global Edits (left box)** â This field initially lists all global edits created for the selected table. To apply a global edit to the batch global edit you are defining, double-click the edit name or click the > button to move the listed edit to the Assigned Global Edits field.

- **Assigned Global Edits (right box)** â This field lists the global edits the batch definition will be used, and the order in which the global edits will be executed. To change the order of the list, select the item to be moved and click the up or down arrows adjacent to the list.

You can also remove any or all of the items in the Assigned Global Edits list by either double-clicking the item name, or clicking it to highlight and then clicking the < button. This will move the selected item or items to the Available Global Edits list.

- **Share this Item with Others** â By default, a batch is only accessible to the user who creates it. By clicking the Share this Item with Others option, it can be made available to other users.

- **Global Edits** â Clicking this button opens the Global Edits dialog box. You would use this option if the global edit you want to include in the batch definition does not exist or if you need to modify an existing global edit before including it in the batch.

> **Note:** To move the entire list, select the list by clicking the first name, then depress the Shift key and click the last name in the list, then click the > button. To select a random group from the list to move, press and hold the CTRL key and click the mouse pointer on the items to be moved to highlight, then click the > button.

### To create a batch global edit definition, complete the following steps:

1. From the Tools tab, click **Batch Global Edits**.
2. From the Display for list on Batch Global Edit dialog box, select the table to which the batch global edit applies.
3. Click **New**.
4. From the Available Global Edits lists, select the global edits to include in the batch definition, and click the right arrow button.
5. You can select multiple global edits to include at once by clicking Ctrl+ or Shift + and selecting the global edits you want to include.
6. If the global edit you want to include is not listed, click the **Global Edits** button to display the Global Edits dialog box that you can use to create the appropriate global edit.
7. In the Assigned Global Edits list, use the up and down arrow buttons to determine the order in which the global edits are to be executed.
8. If you wish to share the batch definition with other users, select the **Share this Item with Others** option.
9. When you are finished defining the batch, click **OK**.

> **Warning:** When a batch is applied, it is first reconciled to verify all referenced global edits exist. If missing global edits are detected, a message is displayed to let you decide if you want to continue to apply the batch or not. If you choose to continue, the batch is applied and the missing global edits are removed from the definition.

## User Defined Validations

Open Plan implements User Defined Validation, allowing you to define and apply your own rules and business logic. This allows customers to ensure that data entered into schedules meets corporate and industry best practice guidelines, and reduces re-work when subsequent schedule quality audits are performed. This set of rules or validations is applied on a per project basis, which means different organizations or customers can have different rules or standards.

> **Note:** Open Plan applies these rules each time you save information.

When you click User Validations on the Tools tab, Open Plan displays the following dialog box:

This dialog box allows you to add, assign, copy, edit, and delete rules for projects.

Before you can assign a rule to a project, make sure that you have already defined the rule or the rule that you need already exists. One of the ways that you can assign a rule to a project is through the Assign User Defined Validations dialog box. This is more useful when assigning the rule to multiple projects. The other way of assigning the rule is through the Validations Tab on the Project Properties dialog box.

Before you can delete a validation rule, you need to remove it from any project to which it is assigned. You cannot delete a rule that has been assigned to a project. If the validation rule that you want to delete is assigned to a project, you need to remove it from that project before you can proceed with the deletion. To check the list of projects or files to which the rule is assigned, click the References button on the User Defined Validation dialog box.

The User Defined Validations dialog box contains the following fields and buttons:

- **Display for** â This drop-down field allows you to select one of the following areas to which you want to apply the validation rule:
  - Activity
  - Relationship
  - Resource Assignment

- **New** â Click this button to add a rule. Clicking it displays the Edit User Defined Validation dialog box.

- **Copy** â Click this button to copy a selected rule. Clicking it displays the Edit User Defined Validation dialog box with values from the copied rule.

- **Edit** â Click this button to edit a selected rule. Clicking it displays the Edit User Defined Validation dialog box.

- **Delete** â Click this button to remove a selected rule from the list.

- **Close** â Click this button to exit the dialog box.

- **Assign** â Click this button to assign a selected rule to specific projects, projects with specific group access, or projects with a specific owner.

- **References** â Click this button to view the projects to which the rule is assigned. Clicking it displays the References dialog box.

Clicking New, Copy, or Edit on the User Defined Validations dialog box displays the Edit User Defined Validation dialog box.

It contains the following fields and buttons:

- **Name** â This field allows you to enter or update a validation name.

- **Applies to Table** â This drop-down field allows you to select an area to which you assign the validation:
  - Activity
  - Relationship
  - Resource Assignment

  If you click Edit on the User Defined Validation dialog box, this field is read-only.

- **Expression** â Enter the syntax or condition of the validation rule. It can be any filter, a calculated field, or a temporary filter expression. Alternatively, you can click **Fields** or **Functions** to select an existing field and/or function when creating or editing expressions.

- **Validation Type** â This drop-down list allows you to select the validation that you want Open Plan to generate:
  - Warning
  - Error

- **Message** â Enter or modify the message that you want to display when users fail the validation.

- **Fields** â Click this button to display the Fields dialog box, allowing you to select a field from an Open Plan data table that you can include in the expression.

- **Functions** â Click this button to display the Functions dialog box, allowing you to select a function that you can use when building the expression.

- **Validate** â Click this button to validate the expression that you entered.

### To create a validation rule, complete the following steps:

1. On the Tools tab, click **User Validations**.
2. On the User Defined Validations dialog box, click **New**.
3. On the Edit User Defined Validations dialog box, enter or select the necessary information.
4. When you are done, click **OK**.

## Calculated Fields

In Open Plan, the data fields displayed in a view are typically one of three types:

- **Normal data entry fields** â for example, an activity ID or description that can be updated by the user at any time
- **Fields generated by Open Plan processes** â for example, the early start and finish dates calculated by time analysis.
- **Calculated fields defined by the user.**

User-defined calculated fields allow you to calculate and display data not stored in the standard versions of the project database tables. With calculated fields, you can extend the flexibility of any view by displaying data that is the result of a custom calculation. Once defined, a calculated field can be treated as any other type of field. For example, you can display that field as a column in a spreadsheet view or in an activity box, just as you can any standard field. You can also include calculated fields in custom filter and sort expressions.

> **Note:** Open Plan does not store the results of calculated fields in the project database. Only the definition of the calculation is saved â the results are recalculated each time the field is required for display. Third-party applications that query the database cannot, therefore, access the results of calculated fields. You can, however, use the global edit feature to place the contents of a calculated field into a user-defined field.

## Defining Calculated Fields

User-defined calculated fields allow you to calculate and display data not stored in the standard versions of the project database tables. With calculated fields, you can extend the flexibility of any view by displaying data that is the result of a custom calculation.

You can use the Calculated Fields command from the Tools tab to define a new calculated field at any time. When you define a new calculated field, Open Plan displays a dialog box in which you can enter a name for the field, the data table to which you want to associate the field, and the type of result produced by the field.

You can define a new calculated field to produce one of the following types of results:

- **Character** â Returns a character string to the calculated field
- **Date** â Returns a date to the calculated field
- **Decimal** â Returns a decimal number (for example, 7.89) to the calculated field
- **Duration** â Returns a duration to the calculated field
- **Finish Date** â Returns an activity finish date to the calculated field
- **Integer** â Returns a whole number to the calculated field
- **Logical** â Returns True or False to the calculated field

Once you provide a name, data table association, and result type for the calculated field, Open Plan allows you to enter the expression for the field.

Use the Fields and Functions commands to display lists of items that you can insert into the expression you are editing.

The **Calculate Summary Rows Horizontally** option applies to calculated fields appearing in summary rows of spreadsheets using grouping. If you select this option, Open Plan calculates the value of the field based on the values of the summarized row, effectively disabling the rolling up of the field. If you leave the option unselected, Open Plan simply rolls up the values appearing in the column. For example, assume that you have defined a calculated field that compares two activity dates. When this calculated field appears in a summary row, it is likely that you want to display a value based on summarized dates rather than one that is the simple aggregation of the calculated values appearing in the column.

You can also change the table and data type assignment for the expression. For expressions that result in decimal data types, you can specify the number of decimal places in the result.

You can define calculated fields for both project and resource files. By default, Open Plan stores the calculated field with the project or resource file that is open when you define the field. (Open Plan may also store the field with the current view if the field is used by the view.)

After you have defined a calculated field, you can select that field as a column in a spreadsheet view or display it in an activity box just as you can any standard field. You can also include calculated fields in custom filter and sort expressions.

The expression for a global edit uses the same elements (constants, field names, and functions) as calculated field definitions.

> **Attention:** For a complete description of the operators and functions available for calculated fields, see The Elements of Calculated Field Expressions and Calculated Field Functions References.

## The Elements of Calculated Field Expressions

An expression defining a calculated field can include the following elements:

- Constants
- Field names
- Functions
- Other calculated fields
- Mathematical operators
- Character operators
- Duration operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- User-Defined Variables

This section discusses each of the elements of a calculated field expression with the exception of functions, which are discussed in the following section.

### Constants

You can include text, date, numeric, and logical constants in a calculated field expression according to the following guidelines:

| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Text | All text must be enclosed in either single or double quotes. For example:<br>â¢ `"Programmers"`<br>â¢ `'Phase I'` |
| Dates | Dates must be enclosed in curly brackets ({ and }) and can be expressed in any valid date format. For example:<br>â¢ `{01JAN01}`<br>â¢ `{12/01/01}` |
| Durations | Durations must be enclosed between pipe characters ( \| ) and can be expressed in any valid duration format. For example:<br>â¢ `\|4h\|`<br>â¢ `\|3.5d\|` |
| Numerics | Numeric constants can include any positive or negative value and can appear with or without decimal places. For example:<br>â¢ `1`<br>â¢ `320000`<br>â¢ `12.1`<br>â¢ `â123.78` |
| Logical Values | Valid logical constants are as follows:<br>â¢ `[TRUE]`<br>â¢ `[FALSE]` |
| Enumerated Values | Values for enumerated fields (that is, fields with a limited number of valid values) must be enclosed between square brackets ([ and ]). For example, an expression can include references to any of the possible values for the Act_type field:<br>â¢ `[ASAP]`<br>â¢ `[ALAP]`<br>â¢ `[Start Milestone]`<br>â¢ `[Finish Milestone]`<br>â¢ `[Discontinuous]`<br>â¢ `[Subproject]`<br>â¢ `[Hammock]`<br>â¢ `[Effort Driven]`<br>â¢ `[External Subproject]` |

Open Plan recognizes the following enumeration types:

- ACTS â Activity Status
- ACTT â Activity Type
- BOOL â Boolean
- CRIT â Critical Flag
- CURV â Curve
- DISTâ Risk
- EVTE â Earned Value Technique
- LOGI â Activity Logic Flag
- PRJS â Project Status
- PROG â Progress
- RELT â Relationship type
- RESC â Resource class
- RSCL â Resource scheduling type
- TARG â Target type

When including a field in an expression for a calculated field, you must enter the name of the field and not the descriptive name that is displayed in spreadsheet column headings. For example, if you want to define a calculated field expression that references the field containing early start dates, you must identify the field as ESDATE, not Early Start.

If you need to refer to fields stored in tables other than the primary data table, use the name of the linking field, followed by a period (.) and the field name in the linked table. For example:

- `C1.DESCRIPTION` â the description for a code stored in the C1 field.
- `RES_ID.DESCRIPTION` â the description for a resource ID stored in the Res_ID field.

> **Note:** If you display the list of available tables and fields by clicking Fields on the Calculated Field Expression dialog box, linking fields are distinguished by a double chevron (Â») next to the field name.

### Other Calculated Fields

Expressions defining calculated fields can include references to previously defined calculated fields.

> **Warning:** A calculated field cannot include a reference to itself.

### Mathematical Operators

You can include the following mathematical operators in a calculated field expression:

- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)
- Group (( ))
- Exponentiate (^ or **)

Expressions containing mathematical operators are evaluated according to the normal rules of precedence:

- Grouping operations are performed before multiplication and division operations.
- Multiplication and division operations are performed before addition and subtraction operations.

### Character Operators

You can include the following character operators in a calculated field expression:

- Concatenate (+)
- Is contained in ($)

The Is contained in operator returns a logical result.

### Duration Operators

You can include the following duration operators in a calculated field expression:

- Add (+)
- Subtract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)

You can use these operators in expressions involving durations as follows:

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration + Duration | Duration |
| Duration + Date | Date |
| Duration â Duration | Duration |
| Date â Duration | Date |
| Duration / Duration | Decimal |
| Duration / Number | Duration |
| Duration * Number | Duration |

### Relational Operators

Expressions for calculated fields can include the following relational operators:

- Equal to (=)
- Not equal to (<>)
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
- Contained in ($)

### Logical Operators

You can include the following logical operators in a calculated field expression:

- AND
- NOT
- OR
- AND NOT
- Group (())

### User-Defined Variables

When Open Plan parses a calculated field (CF) expression, it optimizes the expression internally by looking for multiple occurrences of a subexpression and replacing these occurrences with an internal variable. For example, let's say you have defined another CF called "TimeNowPlusFive":

```
Timenow() + |5d|
```

You then use this CF in another CF:

```
IIF(EFDATE > TimeNowPlusFive, TimeNowPlusFive, EFDATE)
```

Internally, Open Plan will evaluate the TimeNowPlusFive CF only once for a particular cell, and use the result of this evaluation each time the same subexpression is encountered within the CF. In order for Open Plan to perform this optimization, each occurrence of the subexpression must be identical in terms of capitalization and spacing (for example, "EFDATE > ASDATE" is not the same as "efdate     >     asdate"). This optimization is performed automatically and assures efficient evaluation provided that the user has been consistent as explained above in the use of subexpressions that occur multiple times.

Open Plan also provides a second, more pro-active way for the user to write a CF expression by using variables. Two advantages of using this second option are that 1) the expression becomes much more readable and easier to maintain, since redefining the variable needs to be done in only one place, and 2)

# Calculated Field Variables and Functions

the parsing of a very complicated expression that contains variables takes less processing time than the same expression using repeated subexpressions.

These are the rules for using variables within a CF:

- Variables are defined above the main CF expression and are contained within a BEGIN VARIABLES/END VARIABLES block.
- Each variable definition must be on its own line.
- The result type of a variable definition (for example, character, duration, integer, decimal, date, finish date, and logical) is determined automatically by Open Plan.
- Variable names should not contain spaces or be identical to field names, function names, or other items used within Open Plan where ambiguity may occur. For example, a variable named "123" could be confused with a numeric value. "act_id" would be confused with the Open Plan field of the same name.
- Variables are not case sensitive.
- The format for a variable definition is: `<variable name> = <variable expression>`.
- The definition of a variable expression may reference other variables, but referenced variables must have been previously defined.

Here is an example of a CF containing a variable block. Note that the previously defined variable X is included in the definition of variable Y:

```
BEGIN VARIABLES
X = DATEDIFFERENCE(ASDATE, TIMENOW())
Y = IIF(x<=|2d|, IIF(x<=|1d|, 2, 1), -1)
END VARIABLES

IIF(Y>0, "OK", "Warning")
```

## Calculated Field Functions Reference

### ABS()

**Purpose**  
Returns the absolute value of a numeric variable.

**Data type**  
Decimal or integer

**Syntax**  
`ABS(<value>)`

**Where**  
`<value>` is a numeric variable

**Example**  
If y contains the value [4] or [-4], the statement:
```
ABS(y)
```
returns the value [4].

### BASELINE_FIELD()

**Purpose**  
Returns a field from the baseline directory table (OPP_BAS) record associated with the first, second, or third selected project baseline. Note that this function may be used with any table whose records can be associated with a project. This includes the Project Directory, Activity, Relationship, Assignment, Cost, Risk, and Subproject tables.

**Data Type**  
Native type of field requested.

**Syntax**  
`BASELINE_FIELD(<SelectedBaselineIndex>, <BaselineFieldName>)`

**Where**
- `SelectedBaselineIndex` is a number between 1 and 3 indicating from which of the selected baseline objects the data is to be retrieved (note that "0" is also accepted, and will return the same results as "1").
- `BaselineFieldName` is a single or double quote delimited field name indicating the field to be returned. Fields that might be of interest include "BASETYPE" (0 = early, 1 = late, 2 = schedule), "BAS_ID" (baseline name), and "DESCRIPTION."

**Example**  
```
BASELINE_FIELD(1, "DESCRIPTION")
```
If the baseline selected at index 1 for the current project is "PMB," the returned string would be "Performance Measurement Baseline."

### CDOW()

**Purpose**  
Returns the full day of the week (for example, Tuesday).

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`CDOW(<date>)`

**Where**  
`<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 (Tuesday), the statement:
```
CDOW(ESDATE)
```
returns the value Tuesday.

### CMONTH()

**Purpose**  
Returns the full month of the year (for example, October).

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`CMONTH(<date>)`

**Where**  
`<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example**  
Assuming ESDATE is 07OCT04, the statement:
```
MONTH(ESDATE)
```
returns the value October.

### CTOD()

**Purpose**  
The Calendar to Date function converts a character string to a value with a DATE data type. This is useful in calculated field expressions where we want to coerce the result of an operation to type DATE.

**Data type**  
Date

**Syntax**  
`CTOD (<String Expression>)`

**Where**  
`<String Expression>` is a quotation-mark delimited string with a valid date format.

**Example**  
```
CTOD(STR(USER_NUM01) + "/" + STR(USER_NUM02) + STR(YEAR(TIMENOW())))
```
If USER_NUM01 = 12, USER_NUM02 = 31, and Time Now = 1/1/2006, the date result returned will be {12/31/2006}.

### DATE()

**Purpose**  
Returns the current date.

**Data type**  
Date

**Syntax**  
`DATE ( )`

**Example**  
Assuming the current date is October 4, 2004, the statement:
```
DATE( )
```
returns 04OCT04.

### DATEADD()

**Purpose**  
Allows you to add a duration to a date and returns a date.

**Data type**  
Date

**Syntax**  
`DATEADD (<start date>, <duration>, <calendar >)`

**Where**
- `<start date>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<duration>` is a duration field or user-entered value
- `<calendar name>` is the name of the calendar to be used in the calculation. This parameter is optional; if no calendar is specified, Open Plan performs the calculation using the appropriate calendar as follows:
  - If a valid calendar is attached to the project, the function uses the calendar named < Default >.
  - If no calendar is attached to the project, a 40-hour week is assumed.

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is 04OCT04, the statement:
```
DATEADD (ESDATE,|2d|, "CAL1")
```
returns 05OCT04 based on calculations using the calendar named CAL1.

### DATEDIFFERENCE()

**Purpose**  
Returns the difference between two dates as a duration.

**Data type**  
Duration

**Syntax**  
`DATEDIFFERENCE (<date1>, <date2>, <calendar>)`

**Where**
- `<date1>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<date2>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<calendar name>` is the name of the calendar to be used in the calculation. This parameter is optional; if no calendar is specified, Open Plan uses the appropriate calendar as follows:
  - If a valid calendar is attached to the project, the function uses the calendar named < Default >.
  - If no calendar is attached to the project, a 40-hour week is assumed.

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 and EFDATE is 08OCT04, the statement:
```
DATEDIFFERENCE (ESDATE, EFDATE, "CAL1")
```
returns 2d based on calculations using the calendar named CAL1.

> **Note:** If the calculated field or global edit is based on the activity table, you can also specify the fieldname CLH_ID to have Open Plan use the calendar assigned to the specific activity. However, if the global edit is based on the assignment table, specify ID.CLH_ID instead of CLH_ID.

> **Note:** To perform the calculation using the calendar currently assigned to the activity or resource, set the calendar parameter to Calendar. To determine working days based on a specific calendar in the calendar file, set the calendar parameter to the name of the calendar.

### DATEFORMAT()

**Purpose**  
Returns a date in a specified format.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`DATEFORMAT (<date field>, <format string>)`

**Where**
- `<date field>` is a date field or user-entered date
- `<format string>` is the date format

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is October 7, 2004, the statement:
```
DATEFORMAT (ESDATE, "%D%A%Y")
```
returns 07OCT04.

> **Note:** DATEFORMAT() uses the same date formats as those used when specifying dates on the Date Scale Preferences dialog box.

> **Attention:** For a description of date format strings in Open Plan, see Views and Reports Â» Tabs and Dialog Boxes Â» Date Formats Dialog Box in the Deltek Open Plan online help. This information is also available in Date Formats in Open Plan.

### DAY()

**Purpose**  
Returns a numeric value 1 through 31 for the day of the month.

**Data type**  
Integer

**Syntax**  
`DAY(<date>)`

**Where**  
`<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is 04OCT04, the statement:
```
DAY(ESDATE)
```
returns 4.

### DOW()

**Purpose**  
Returns a numeric value 1 through 7 for the day of the week. The actual number returned depends on settings in the Open Plan .ini file for the first day of the week.

**Data type**  
Integer

**Syntax**  
`DOW(<date>)`

**Where**  
`<date>` is a date variable or user-entered date

**Example**  
Assuming that ESDATE is 07OCT04 (Tuesday), the statement:
```
DOW(ESDATE)
```
returns 3.

### DURATION()

**Purpose**  
Returns the number of minutes corresponding to a given duration

**Data type**  
Integer

**Syntax**  
`DURATION(<Duration Value>)`

**Where**  
`<Duration Value>` is a duration variable or user-entered duration

**Example**  
Assuming an 8-hour workday, the statement:
```
Duration(|2d|)
```
returns 960 (8 hours x 2 days x 60 minutes/hour).

### EVAL()

**Purpose**  
Evaluates its string expression argument as a dynamic calculated field rather than as a string literal.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`EVAL(<exp>)`

**Where**  
`<exp>` evaluates a string expression argument to be calculated as a dynamic calculated field rather than as a string literal.

**Example**  
Assuming that the value of USER_CHR01 is "ESDATE" and USER_CHR02 is "EFDATE" and that ESDATE is 04OCT04 and EFDATE is 06OCT04, the statement:
```
EVAL('CTOD(USER_CHR02) - CTOD(USER_CHR01)')
```
returns a duration of 2d.

### FAIL_EVALUATE()

**Purpose**  
Test for a condition that normally would cause the calculated field to return either a blank value or an invalid result (the latter would keep the remainder of the expression from being evaluated).

**Data type**  
Boolean

**Syntax**  
`FAIL_EVALUATE(<String Expression>)`

**Where**  
`<String Expression>` is an expression in string format.

**Example**  
```
FAIL_EVALUATE("C25")
```
If there is no code file assigned at index 25, this calculated field will return True. Note that if we substituted the expression "C25 IS_EMPTY" as an alternative to using FAIL_EVALUATE, the returned value would be True whether C25 does not exist or C25 exists but is blank.

### FISCALPERIOD()

**Purpose**  
This function returns the user-defined label for a specific fiscal reporting period for a specific date.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`FISCALPERIOD(<Date>,<Reporting Calendar>)`

**Where**
- `<Date>` is the search date to be located within a fiscal period.
- `< Reporting Calendar>` is an optional parameter (defaulting to the project reporting calendar).

**Example**  
```
FISCALPERIOD(ESDATE)
FISCALPERIOD(ESDATE, "REPORTING_CALENDAR_NAME")
```
The function returns the LABEL field from the reporting calendar that includes the supplied date. For example, given the following DATE and LABEL fields:

| DATE | LABEL |
|------|-------|
| 01/26/2001 | Jan 2001 |
| 02/23/2001 | Feb 2001 |
| 03/23/2001 | Mar 2001 |

### FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM()

**Purpose**  
Creates custom grouping heading with summary rows (i.e., the summary type for the grouping row is marked as "Heading").

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(<Expression>,<WidthInCharUnits>, <Wordwrap>,<Summarize>)`

**Where**
- `<Expression>` is the character string to be formatted
- `<WidthInCharUnits>` is the width of the expression in character units
- `<Wordwrap>` is the numeric value 0 (no word wrap) or 1 (word wrap active)
- `<Summarize>` is an OPTIONAL argument indicating whether `<Expression>` (if not a constant) should NOT be summarized (numeric value of 0), or should be summarized (numeric value of 1). The default value is 1.

**Example**  
Given the following calculated field expression:
```
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2 + " - ," 20,0,0) +
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2.DESCRIPTION, 40, 1,0) +
FORMAT_HEADING_ITEM(C2.< Default >,20,1,0)
```
The output in a spreadsheet grouping on C2, using the above calculated field as the Heading Field would look similar to this:

### GET_ASSGNS()

**Purpose**  
Returns assignment data for an activity.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_ASSGNS(<fieldname1>[ |<fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where**  
`<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Resource Assignment table

> **Note:** Because the GET_ASSGNS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

**Example**  
Assuming that the resource assignments for the activity are ENG (a level 1 resource pool) and TECH.MARY (a level 2 resource), the statement:
```
GET_ASSGNS("RES_ID|RES_LEVEL")
```
It then returns ENG,1.00;TECH.MARY,2.00.

### GET_CHILDREN()

**Purpose**  
Returns a list of fields from the immediate children of the current hierarchical record (activities, resources, and codes).

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_CHILDREN(<FieldList>)`

**Where**  
FieldList is a pipe-delimited string containing the list of fields to be returned. Fields are separated by commas, and records are separated by semi-colons in the returned data.

**Example**  
```
GET_CHILDREN("ACT_ID|DESCRIPTION")
```
Given an activity "1.01," with children, "1.01.01" and "1.01.02," the returned string would be the following:
"1.01.01,First child of 1.01;1.01.02,Second child of 1.01"

### GET_COSTS()

**Purpose**  
This function returns cost records for an activity.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_COSTS(<fieldname1>[ | <fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where**  
`<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Cost table

> **Note:** Because the GET_COSTS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

**Example**  
Assuming that there are two cost records for the activity, that the actual costs are 1,000 and 4,000, and that the actual quantities are 1 and 2, the statement:
```
GET_COSTS("ACWP_CST|ACWP_QTY")
```
It then returns 1000.00,1.00;4000.00,2.00.

### GET_FIELD()

**Purpose**  
This function allows users to display data from other tables or data from other records in the same table.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_FIELD (<TableType>, <UniqueID>,<FieldName>)`

**Where**
- `TableType` = "Activity","Resource","Calendar","B1","B2","B3" (Selected Baseline Activity Tables), "ProjDir","CodeDir","ResDir","CalDir".
- `UniqueID` = a constant, expression, or field name that identifies a look-up key for the table type. Note that the only acceptable table types are those that have unique identifiers (for example, the activity ID on the activity table, or the project name on the Project Directory).
- `FieldName` = the field in Table TableType whose value we want returned. Note that the field name MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. Otherwise, the VALUE of the field, not the field name itself, will be passed as the argument.

> **Note:** TableType = "Resource" will pull data from the "Resource Data" table.

**Example**  
```
GET_FIELD("C2,"PARENT(C2), "DESCRIPTION")
```
On the Activity table, if the current Activity has a code 2 value of "1.2.1.3," the returned string would be "1.2.1. System Engineering."

### GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY()

**Purpose**  
This function returns the value for the requested field. For a grouping summary row, it returns the value of the requested field for the first child record.

**Data type**  
Same data type as input field

**Syntax**  
`GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY (<TableType>, <UniqueID>,<FieldName>)`

**Where**  
FieldName = the field in Table TableType whose value we want returned. Note that the field name MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. Otherwise, the VALUE of the field, not the field name itself, will be passed as the argument.

**Example**  
The purpose of the GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY function is to allow the user to construct a calculated field result in a summary row that uses a break column value rather than a summary value. For example, given the following filter in a barchart (with a visibility setting of "All levels of Rollup and Detail"), with a spreadsheet pane grouped on TOTALFLOAT:

```
TOTALFLOAT > |2d|
```

The filter would evaluate to TRUE for all child rows of groupings where the TOTALFLOAT break-on value is greater than |2d|. However, the filter would evaluate to FALSE on the grouping summary rows since the value of the TOTALFLOAT field on the summary row is undefined (durations cannot be summarized). Even for a numeric or date field (which can be summarized), the filter would have to be written differently to account for a summarized value on a summary row. To work around this problem, the following syntax will give us the result we want:

```
GET_FIRST_RECORD_IN_SUMMARY("TOTALFLOAT") > |2d|
```

### GET_NOTE()

**Purpose**  
Returns an activity, resource, or code note.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_NOTE(<category>)`

**Where**  
`<category>` is the name of a note category. This field is optional.
If you leave `<category>` blank, the function assumes the default category.

**Example**  
Assuming that a category <Document> has been set up for an activity table, the statement:
```
GET_NOTE("Document")
```
returns the Document category note about the activity.

**Example**  
Assuming that you want to use the default category for an activity note, the statement:
```
GET_NOTE("")
```
returns the default category note about the activity.

### GET_PREDS()

**Purpose**  
Returns predecessor data for an activity.

**Data type**  
Character

**Syntax**  
`GET_PREDS(<fieldname1>[ |<fieldname2>â¦])`

**Where**  
`<fieldname1>`, `<fieldname2>` are names of fields in the Relationship table

> **Note:** Because the GET_PREDS() function works within a specified data table, it is important that the table portion of the fieldname (added when you select Fields via the Fields button) be removed when using this function.
> 
> The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks. The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

**Example**  
Assuming that the predecessor to an activity is A100 and that the relationship type is Finish to Start, the statement:
```
GET_PREDS("PRED_ACT_ID|REL_TYPE")
```
It then returns A100,Finish to Start.

### GET_RELATED()

**Purpose**  
Returns a list of fields for a each member of a child collection related to the main collection. This is basically a more generic version of the more specialized functions GET_PREDS(), GET_SUCCS(), GET_ASSGNS(), etc.

**Syntax**  
`GET_RELATED(<CollectionType>, <FieldList>)`

**Where**  
`< CollectionType >` is a quotation-mark delimited identifier.

**Main Collection = "Activity"**
- "A01","A02","A03" (Selected Baseline Activity Collection)
- "ASG" (assignment collection)
- "CST" (cost collection)
- "PRD" (predecessor collection)
- "RSK" (risk collection)
- "SUB" (subproject collection)
- "SUC" (successor collection)
- "U01","U02","U03" (Selected Baseline Usage Collection)
- "USE" (usage collection)

**Main Collection = "Baseline Activity"**
- "SUB" (subproject collection)
- "USE" or "BSU" (baseline usage)

**Main Collection = "Resource Data"**
- "PSU" (Project Summary Usage)
- "RSL" (Resource Escalations)
- "SKL" (All skill assignments for the given resource record)
- "SKR" (All skill assignments for the given skill record)

`<FieldList>` is a pipe-delimited string containing the list of fields to be returned. Fields are separated by commas, and records are separated by semi-colons in the returned data.

**Example**  
Assuming that we are displaying an activity spreadsheet, and that activity "A" is the current activity, the expression below will return the activity ID and early start fields for the record that matches the activity on the first selected baseline.
```
GET_RELATED("A01","ACT_ID|ESDATE")
```
returns "A,12Oct04"

### GET_RELATED_COUNT()

**Purpose**  
Returns a record count. The two parameters for the function are the related collection identifier and an optional filter. You use this primarily with activity and baseline activity tables.

**Data type**  
String

**Syntax**  
`GET_RELATED_COUNT(RELATED_COLLECTION_IDENTIFIER, <FILTER_ON_RELATED_COLLECTION>)`

**Where**  
You can use the function with one of the following related collection identifiers:

**Main Collection = "Activity"**
- "ASG" (assignment collection)
- "CHILD" (child collection)
- "CST" (cost collection)
- "PRD" (predecessor collection)
- "RSK" (risk collection)
- "STP" (step collection)
- "SUB" (subproject collection)
- "SUC" (successor collection)
- "USE" (usage collection)

**Main Collection = "Baseline Activity"**
- "CHILD" (child collection)
- "USE" (usage collection)

**Example**  
You might want a count of all children for a subproject activity (`GET_RELATED_COUNT("CHILD")`), or you may want to get a count of all predecessors for a particular activity with a relationship lag of 0 (`GET_RELATED_COUNT(PRD", "REL_LAG = |0|"`).

### GET_RISKS()

> **Note:** The pipe symbol (|) is used as a separator between the desired fields. The entire expression within the set of () must be enclosed by quotation marks.
> 
> The text string returned for this function uses commas (,) to separate the different data items within each record and uses semi-colons (;) to separate each record.

**Example**  
The statement:
```
GET_RISKS("ESDATE1")
```
returns each early start date calculated during risk analysis.

- `<value>` is a numeric variable or constant
- `<precision>` is a positive or negative number. If positive, `<precision>` represents the number of decimal places. A negative precision represents rounding that occurs to the left of the decimal point, i.e., integer rounding (with the decimal point being at precision 0). A â1 represents units of 10, -2 represents units of 100, and â3 represents units of 1000 (10 to the first, second, and third powers, respectively). With a precision of â1, the last two digits of a given number will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.

You can also modify the precision of a duration using one of the following codes:
- `t` (minutes)
- `h` (hours)
- `d` (days)
- `w` (weeks)
- `m` (months)

- `<type>` indicates how Open Plan should round. Valid values are "up" (rounds all decimals up), "down" (rounds all decimals down), or the field can be empty (rounds up values =>.5, and rounds down values <.5) This parameter is optional.

**Example**
The statement:

## Temporary Calculated Fields

In addition to allowing you to name and save calculated fields for future use, Open Plan allows you to create and use temporary calculated fields in the following circumstances:

- Export scripts
- Spreadsheet Add, Insert, and Edit Column dialog boxes
- Multi-table define links
- When defining the box layouts for the network and hierarchy views
- When defining box attributes for the network view
- OLE automation

These temporary calculated fields are not displayed in the Calculated Fields dialog box. They are not saved as part of the project. If you save the view while a temporary calculated field is in effect, Open Plan saves the view with the definition applied.

### To define a temporary calculated field in a network view:

1. Display the network view to which you want to apply the temporary calculated field.
2. Take one of the following actions:
   - On the View tab, click Preferences.
   - Right-click an empty area of the view, and click Preferences on the context menu.
3. On the Preferences dialog box, click the Box Attribute or the Box Layout tab.
4. Enter the temporary calculated field in the Criterion or Field column, and click OK.

Open Plan displays the results of the calculated field in the network view.

### To define a temporary calculated field in a spreadsheet view:

1. Display the spreadsheet view to which you want to apply the temporary calculated field.
2. Right-click the column heading, and click Add, Insert, or Edit column.
3. Enter the calculated field in the Field Name field and a column title in the Title field, and click OK.

Open Plan displays the results of the calculated field in the selected column.

## Spread Curves

Spread curves allow you to define the manner in which a resource assignment is distributed over the duration of an activity. When assigning a resource to an activity, you can use the Curve field on the Resources tab of the Activity Details dialog box to select a predefined spread curve.

When you click Spread Curves on the Tools tab, Open Plan displays a dialog box that lists the spread curves defined for Open Plan. Using this dialog box, you can create a new spread curve, edit a spread curve, or delete a spread curve.

Clicking New on the Spread Curves dialog box displays the New Spread Curve dialog box with the following controls:

- **Name** â Open Plan uses the (single) character entered in this field to identify the spread curve. If you enter a character that is already in use for another spread curve, Open Plan issues a warning when you click OK.
- **Description** â This field allows you to specify a more descriptive name for the spread curve. Once defined, the spread curve is identified by both its Name and its Description. You cannot leave this field blank. You must enter a description for the spread curve.
- **Cumulative** â As you enter values in the grid, Open Plan recalculates the values and displays the current total in column 10 of the Cumulative row.
- **Incremental** â The values in the Incremental row allow you to define the percentage to be applied to each specific period.
- **Reconcile** â If you click this button, Open Plan ensures that the value in column 10 of the Cumulative row equals 100%. If necessary, Open Plan redistributes the values in the remaining cells in such a manner as to honor your inputs to the extent that it is possible.

When you select an existing spread curve from the Spread Curve dialog box and click Edit, Open Plan displays the Edit Spread Curve dialog box. This dialog box is the same as the New Spread Curve dialog box except that the Name field is disabled. You can edit only the description and percentage values in the Cumulative and Incremental rows.

> **Note:** Be aware that modifying or deleting a spread curve that is in use by another project will affect the project the next time resource scheduling is performed or a baseline is updated.

### To create a new spread curve:

1. On the Tools tab, click Spread Curves.
2. On the Spread Curve dialog box, click New.
3. In the Name field of the New Spread Curve dialog box, enter a single character to serve as the name.
4. In the Description field, enter a longer description for the spread curve.
5. In the grid at the bottom of the dialog box, enter the appropriate values in any combination of cells in the Cumulative and Incremental rows. The total in the Cumulative row is displayed in column 10. This value must equal 100%.
6. Click Reconcile to ensure that the values in each column of the Cumulative row are correct.
7. Click OK.

### To edit a spread curve:

1. On the Tools tab, click Spread Curve.
2. From the Spread Curve dialog box, select the spread curve to edit.
3. Click Edit.
4. In the Edit Spread Curve dialog box, enter a new description and percentage values as desired. The total in the Cumulative row is displayed in column 10. This value must equal 100%.
5. Click Reconcile to ensure that the values in each column of the Cumulative row are correct.
6. Click OK.

### To delete a spread curve:

1. On the tools tab, click Spread Curves.
2. From the Spread Curve dialog box, select the spread curve to delete.
3. Click Delete.

## Spread Curve Profiles

In Open Plan, resource and cost assignment profiles can be defined by spread curves that describe how the assignment is spread through the duration of an activity. Open Plan provides the following standard profiles:

- Back load (B)
- Double peak (D)
- Early peak (E)
- Front load (F)
- Late peak (L)
- Bell (Normal) (N)
- Linear (T)

All assignment profiles are described by defining values for 10 evenly spaced percentile points, which are then mapped to the activity duration. The following sections discuss each of these assignment profiles in more detail.

### Back Load Profile

The back load assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated toward the end of the activity duration. The curve code for a back load assignment profile is B.

| Inc. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 30 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|
| Cum. | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 65 | 95 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Double Peak Profile

The double peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated to two peaks â one near the beginning of the activity duration, and one near the end. The curve code for a double peak assignment profile is D.

| Inc. | 20 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 10 | 15 |
|------|----|----|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|
| Cum. | 20 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 55 | 75 | 85 | 100 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Early Peak Profile

The early peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated near the beginning of the activity duration. The curve code for an early peak assignment profile is E.

| Inc. | 25 | 20 | 15 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
|------|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cum. | 25 | 45 | 60 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 100 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Front Load Profile

The front load assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated at the beginning of the activity duration. The curve code for a front load assignment profile is F.

| Inc. | 30 | 20 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
|------|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cum. | 30 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 100 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Late Peak Profile

The late peak assignment profile describes an assignment in which most of the resource effort is allocated near the end of the activity duration. The curve code for a late peak assignment profile is L.

| Inc. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 20 | 25 | 15 | 15 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|
| Cum. | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 45 | 70 | 85 | 100 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Bell (Normal) Profile

The bell (normal) assignment profile describes an assignment in which a large proportion of the resource effort is allocated near the middle of the activity duration. The resource effort starts with a minimal effort, gradually increases to the middle of the duration, and then tapers off toward the end. The curve code for a bell (normal) assignment profile is N.

| Inc. | 5 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 10 |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| Cum. | 5 | 15 | 25 | 45 | 65 | 75 | 85 | 90 | 100 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

### Linear Profile

The linear assignment profile describes an assignment in which the resource effort is allocated as evenly as possible throughout the activity duration. The curve code for a linear assignment profile is T.

| Inc. | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| Cum. | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 |
| **Position** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** |

# Frequently Asked Questions

This topic is designed to provide answers to some frequently asked questions about Open Plan.

## Spreadsheet Views

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why does Open Plan Professional sometimes prevent me from defining a grouping in a spreadsheet view? | If you are doing a grouping across tables (for example, you want to display both activity and resource information), then grouping is not allowed in a single table view. You can use a Multi-Table view and grouping across tables. |
| I have grouping turned on in a spreadsheet view and a blank row is inserted. If I put something in that blank row and then click somewhere outside of that row, the row I typed in disappears. What's happening? | The row you typed in did not disappear. It was moved to the appropriate location based on the grouping criteria. |
| I applied a filter to my spreadsheet, and it worked fine. Then I added a new row that should have been filtered out. Even when I clicked away from the row, the new row stayed. Why? | When a filter is applied to a view, the view compares all existing records to the filter. As you add new records, however, Open Plan does not apply the filter to these records. Keeping this information visible allows you to review newly-entered data and make any changes. To see the effect of the filter on any new data, re-apply the filter to the view. |
| I saved a multi-table spreadsheet view with a link in it as a template. Now I can't get the view to open. | If there is a case where a link has no columns in it, then the spreadsheet view will not display. One possible reason is that the link definition may not be valid for this particular project. For example, the link included either the baseline activity or baseline usage table, but the project in question doesn't have a baseline or no baseline is selected. |

## Barchart Views

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why does my barchart report start at the wrong date? | You need to set the project dates you wish to display in the Print Options dialog box. |
| Why are my bars printing solid black? | Check the settings in your Windows printer configuration. The Control Panel/Printers/Setup/Options dialog box is specific to your output device. If your printer supports a Dithering option, make sure that it is set to either Fine or LineArt. |
| I don't understand why the label for my reporting calendar is showing up at the end of the period. How is this label associated with the period? | When using reporting calendars, each interval to be marked is defined by a pair of dates. If the caption is positioned at the center or right of the interval being marked, it corresponds to the date at the end of the period; otherwise, it corresponds to the date at the beginning. This is also the case with regular date ribbons (that is, without a reporting calendar). |
| I created a new bar. Why is my new bar not appearing? | Check the visibility setting in the Bar Set Preferences dialog box. If this seems to be correct, check that you do not have a filter set that excludes activities that use the bar. Note that if a filter excludes an activity, it also excludes its children. |
| How can I increase the number of lines shown in the barchart view? | You can reduce the font size on the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box. Then you can reduce the row height in the Bar Types dialog box. This dialog box is accessed from the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box. |
| How do I roll up on codes in the barchart view? | Assume that you want to roll up to Level 2 of the code file stored in the C1 field. Display an activity barchart view and follow this procedure:<br/>1. From the View tab, click Preferences from the Spreadsheet group.<br/>2. On the Options tab of the Spreadsheet Preferences dialog box, select Enable Groupings.<br/>3. Display the Grouping tab, and set up a grouping heading using the following controls:<br/>â¢ Break On â C1<br/>â¢ Break Level â Enter the level at which you want the grouping to break. For example, enter 2 to break at level 2.<br/>â¢ Background â Select a color to distinguish the rolled up rows from the detail levels.<br/>â¢ Heading â Select Yes.<br/>â¢ Summary â Select Top.<br/>â¢ Heading Field â Leave as <Default><br/>4. On the View tab, click Bar Sets and select the current bar set.<br/>5. Display the Bar Attributes tab of the Bar Set Preferences dialog box, and set up a new bar using the following controls:<br/>â¢ Criterion â Leave this field blank.<br/>â¢ Bar Type â Early Dates<br/>â¢ Pattern â Your choice<br/>â¢ Outline â Your choice<br/>â¢ Fill â Your choice<br/>â¢ Visibility â Grouping Summary Only<br/>â¢ Label â Summary |
| Where can I see activities and resources listed on one table? | Use an activity/resource barchart view or use a multi-table spreadsheet/barchart view and define the link appropriately. |

## Histogram Views

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why is the Select Resource option dimmed out in my histogram view? | A resource file is not attached to the project. Assign an existing resource file to your project using one of the following procedures:<br/>â¢ In the Open Plan Explorer, open the Resources folder located in the Open Plan Library folder. Drag the icon representing the resource file onto your project folder.<br/>â¢ Select the project folder and click Properties on the project name. On the Files tab, click the ellipsis to the right of the Resource Definition File field. Then select the resource file from the list or create a new one. |
| How exactly is the data plotted in histogram views? | When the histogram shows cumulative data, which is done as an S-curve rather than a histogram, the plotted points are at the boundaries of the intervals and represent the data at those points. By contrast, histogram bars represent the incremental amount occurring between the start and the finish of the interval. If the cross-table is present, the data displayed in a particular column represents the values plotted at the end of that interval.<br/>For more information, see Histogram Views. |
| Why is a histogram view truncating my data? I am trying to show 20 years of dates using hourly intervals. | Histogram views have a default limit of displaying approximately 100000 intervals. (You can modify this default limit by changing a setting within Open Plan.) To change the setting, follow this procedure:<br/>1. In a histogram view, display the Options dialog box by clicking the File menu Â» Preferences Â» Application.<br/>2. On the Advanced tab, select HistogramArrayLimit from the list.<br/>3. The default value is set to 100000. Enter a new value for the appropriate number of intervals.<br/>4. Click OK.<br/>The default limit of 100000 intervals allow you to represent approximately 8 years in days and approximately 4 months in hours. We recommend that you choose an appropriate date scale interval for the length of the project, typically weeks for a long project. Or you can use a reporting calendar, which can combine different intervals. |

## Resources

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why do I sometimes show overloaded resources after resource-limited resource scheduling? | Check the scheduling interval specified on the Advanced tab in the Resource Scheduling dialog box. This should correspond to the intervals defined in the calendars used by the project. For example, even if you defined all activity durations in days, you may have an activity or resource calendar that breaks the workday into two 4-hour shifts.<br/>Moreover, scheduling intervals are defined as starting at 12:00 midnight. (Thus, 6-hour scheduling intervals start at 12:00AM, 6:00AM, 12:00PM, and 6:00PM.) If the pattern of working intervals defined in a calendar does not match up with the pattern of scheduling intervals, Open Plan may calculate a resource overload in certain situations. By reducing the scheduling interval to a smaller unit, the calculations will yield the correct results.<br/>It is also possible to overload resources during resource-limited scheduling in the following situations:<br/>â¢ When you have assigned resources to a subproject<br/>â¢ When you have assigned resources to a hammock<br/>â¢ When you have assigned the Immediate attribute to an activity |
| Why aren't my resources being progressed? | The option to automatically progress resources based on activity progress may not be enabled. To make sure this option is enabled for each resource you want to progress, use one of the following procedures:<br/>â¢ Display the Resource Details dialog box for each resource.<br/>â¢ Add a column to a resource/activity spreadsheet view that displays the Progress Based on Activity Progress field from the Resource table. |

## Calculated Fields

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| I am trying to define a calculated field that calculates early start + 10 days by using ESDATE + \|10d\|, but I keep getting a date which is only 3 days later than the early start date. Why? | Durations used in calculations use the project definition of what a day or week or month is. So if a day is defined as 8 hours, then ESDATE + \|10d\| will add 80 hours to the date, which is a little over 3 days. To add 10 days, use 240 hours. The same is true if you use the DATEADD and DATEDIFFERENCE functions without a calendar. As an alternative, try DATEADD(esdate, \|10d\|, calendar). |
| I am testing a value in a calculated field, but the test never seems to be true. | Check to see what field is being tested. For example, a code field actually contains a character value, not a numeric. Therefore, in order to test for the value 1, you might use a calculation such as IIF (C1 = "1", 1, 2) and not IIF(C1=1, 1, 2). |
| What is the maximum number of characters that can be returned by a calculated field? | For a calculated field returning a character result, the maximum length is approximately 32,765 characters. |

## Durations

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| When I enter values in duration fields with a time unit (for example, 1M), I do not always get the results I expect. Why is this? | In duration fields, the use of days, weeks, and months is merely a data entry convenience and should not be taken too literally. These periods are exactly as defined in the Preferences tab of the Project Properties dialog box. By default, a month is 160 hours; if you use this default, entering 1M for an activity duration is exactly the same as entering 160H. If you subsequently alter the definition of a month, then any duration entered in months will be changed. In this case, if you change the definition of month from 160 to 168, the duration will still appear as months, but the activity scheduled will take 168 hours instead of 160 hours. |
| Why does Open Plan sometimes show durations for a summary activity such as a subproject or a hammock in minutes even though I have defined the durations of all of the detail activities in days? | This is usually due to the use of activity calendars that do not match the project definition of a day (defined on the Preferences tab of the Project Properties dialog box). Although Open Plan allows you to mix calendar and duration units within a project, on any individual activity it is desirable that they be consistent. For example, if durations are to be input in days for a particular set of activities, then the calendar on those activities should define all working days as the same length, and this length should match the project definition of a day. |
| Why did a 3-day activity that is progressed as 75% complete show one day remaining? | If the original duration is measured in days, then progress will normally be rounded to the nearest day. This can easily be overridden by typing in a remaining or elapsed duration in different units. If you want to define a 3-day activity (with each day consisting of 8 hours) as exactly 75% complete, enter 6 hours for the remaining duration. |

## Miscellaneous

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| I'm tired of typing in the entire word in lists when the choice is right there in the list: Do I have to type the entire word each time to select it? | You need to type only enough characters to uniquely identify the choice before pressing the Enter key. |
| How do I assign multiple calendars to my project? | While only one calendar file can be assigned to a project at any one time, this calendar file can contain any number of individual calendars. Once you have stored calendars in the calendar file, you can assign specific calendars to resources, activities, and relationship lags. |
| How do I view a session log? | By default, if errors occur when running a process (resource scheduling, time analysis, etc.), Open Plan will prompt you to view the session log. To view a session log, click Open Log on the Processes tab, and click the appropriate session log tab.

# Appendix A: Create/Update Baseline Option Flags

In version 8.0 of Open Plan Professional, more options were added to the CreateBaselineWithOptionFlags() and UpdateBaselineWithOptionFlags() methods. In order to be backwards compatible, these options are only active when the flag Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 is set. Otherwise, they are ignored.

The following table lists the names of each flag, a description of its usage, whether it is used when creating or updating the baseline, and in which version of the interface it is valid.

| Flag | Description | Used when Creating/Updating Baseline | Version | Value |
|------|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| Baseline_Include_In_Progress_Activities | Set this flag to include in-progress activities in update logic. | Create/Update | Version 1 & 2 | 1 |
| Baseline_Include_Completed_Activities | Set this flag to include completed activities in update logic. | Create/Update | Version 1 & 2 | 2 |
| Baseline_Existing_Replaced_By_Progressed_Dates | If the flags 'Baseline_Use_Project_Start' and 'Baseline_Update_Data' are set, the 'Baseline_Existing_Replaced_By_Progressed_Dates' flag controls whether or not dates in the baseline activity record are modified. When clear, dates in the baseline activity records are preserved. When set, dates in the baseline activity records are replaced with dates from the associated activity record. | Create/Update | Version 1 Only | 4 |
| Baseline_Rollup_Data | Set this flag to roll up all dates, budget cost, and labor quantity data in the baseline to the parent levels. | Create/Update | Version 1 & 2 | 8 |
| Baseline_Delete_Deleted_Activities | Set this flag to remove any activities from the baseline that no longer exist in the current project. | Update | Version 1 & 2 | 16 |
| Baseline_Use_External_Baselines | Set this flag for Open Plan to use baseline information from external subprojects. Only valid when adding Baseline of the same name as the selected master baseline. | Create | Version 1 & 2 | 32 |
| Baseline_Use_Remaining_For_Planned_Activities | Set this flag to update baseline activity resource requirements from the remaining resource requirements instead of the budget resource requirements for activities that are not in-progress or complete. This flag is not available when the baseline is based on Schedule Dates. | Create/Update | Version 1 & 2 | 64 |
| Baseline_Use_Project_Start | Set this flag to create baseline dates by performing a time analysis from the project start date. This flag is not available when the baseline is based on Schedule Dates. | Create | Version 1 & 2 | 128 |
| Baseline_Update_Data | When set, activities already in the baseline are updated. In version 1, all data (Codes, UDFs, and Descriptions) and Resource Quantities are updated when this flag is set. Baseline Activity dates may or may not be set, depending on the value of 'Baseline_Existing_Replaced_By_Progressed_Dates' (See description below) In version 2, only the data (Codes, UDFs, and Descriptions) is updated. In Version 1: This flag is only valid in Open Plan 3.5, and earlier, and is only enabled if the Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 flag is NOT set. In Version 2: This flag is only valid in Open Plan 8.0 or higher, and is only enabled if the Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 flag is set. | Update | Version 1 & 2 | 256 |
| Baseline_Replace_Dates | Set this flag to instruct Open Plan to replace the baseline dates of activities that already exist in the baseline. This flag is only valid in Open Plan 8.0 or higher, and is only enabled if the Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 flag is set. | Update | Version 2 Only | 512 |
| Baseline_Update_Resources | Set this flag to instruct Open Plan to update baseline activity resource usage. When baseline dates are to be replaced, the resources will be updated. When not replacing the baseline dates, and if resources have changed, the current quantity will be evenly spread across the original baseline dates or a subset of the original baseline dates, depending on actual cost record dates and other factors. This flag is only valid in Open Plan 8.0 or higher, and is only enabled if the Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 flag is set. | Update | Version 2 Only | 1024 |
| Baseline_Update_External_Subprojects | This flag is ignored if the Use Baseline of Same Name on External Subprojects option was not selected when this baseline was created. If this flag is set, in order for the external subproject baselines to be updated, you must have rights to update the external baseline. These rights are granted in the Baseline Access Control dialog box for each of the external baselines. The Update in the Master field must be set to Yes for each external baseline to be updated. This flag is only valid in Open Plan 8.0 or higher, and is only enabled if the Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 flag is set. | Update | Version 2 Only | 2048 |
| Baseline_Use_Intfc_V2 | When set, enables Version-2 only flags and associated logic. When clear, Version 2 flags are ignored. | Update | Version 2 Only | 4096 |

## Table WST_PFA - Product Function Group Access Rights

Access rights to a product function group are assigned for each role that the administrator has defined. These access rights are stored in the Product Function Group Access Rights table. Records in this table represent the intersection of a Role and a Product Function group and the specified access rights.

Each function group has 2 security attributes that can be controlled. The first attribute controls the visible state of securable objects in the function group as Visible or Not Visible. The second attribute controls the enabled state of securable objects in the function group as Enabled or Not Enabled.

The access attributes are stored in a single field using the following definitions:

- **FLAG_VISIBLE Mask = 0x00000001L**
  - 0 = Not Visible
  - 1 = Visible
- **FLAG_ENABLED Mask = 0x00000002L**
  - 0 = Not Enabled
  - 1 = Enabled

These flags are independent so that a user may be granted rights to execute a command or modify a data element even if it is not displayed to the user because of the state of the visibility flag. Data in the access rights table is stored in a sparse format such that records exist only for items that do not have rights granted to them. If an item is specified as both visible and enabled, then a record does not exist in the access rights table. If an item is specified as not visible and/or not enabled, then records are placed in the access rights table. This table is not defined in the Open Plan data dictionary, and its structure must not be changed.

## Table WST_PFD - Project Function Group Detail

The Product Function Group Details table stores the associations of Securable objects to function groups. This table is used by the Security Runtime module to determine the securable objects that are controlled by a particular function group. It is not referenced by the Security administration module. This table is not defined in the Open Plan data dictionary, and its structure must not be changed.

| PFG_UID | None | The unique identifier of a product function group record. | None | VARCHAR2(22) | NOT NULL |

## Table WST_PFG - Product Function Group Definitions

The Product Function Group table stores a collection of one or more Securable objects that are controlled as a single item for purposes of defining access control. For instance, the user might define a function group that contains a single command. This group can then be set to define whether or not a user can execute that command. Another function group might be made up of a group of data elements that are secured as a group such as the fields that make up Activity Costs. Another function group could be defined to control the ability to update Activity Progress. This function group might contain both command and data elements to prevent the user from both displaying the progress dialog as well as changing the data elements through a spreadsheet.

As implied by their title, product function groups are defined by each product. Product function groups are also defined as applying to either a Group or a Role based on the value of the TYPE field. A TYPE field value of 0 represents a Group, a value of 1 represents a Role. Function groups defined for groups are displayed as part of the Group administration module by product.
