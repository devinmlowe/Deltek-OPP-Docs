# Introduction to OLE Automation

## What is OLE Automation?

OLE automation is a feature of the Windows operating systems family that allows different Windows applications to share data and functionality. OLE automation lets you easily extend the capabilities of Open Plan with powerful, low-maintenance solutions designed with the tools that best suit your needs and abilities.

## Open Plan as an OLE Server

One of the most powerful features in Open Plan is its support of the robust and flexible technology of OLE automation. Open Plan is designed as an **OLE server application**, exposing a variety of objects, properties, and methods for use with other Windows applications such as:

- Visual FoxPro
- Visual Basic
- Microsoft Excel
- And many others

## Core Concepts

### Objects

The fundamental unit of data or functionality exposed by a server application. See [Understanding Objects](../objects/README.md) for more details.

### Collections

Objects that contain groups of other objects. See [Collections Reference](../objects/collections.md) for more details.

### Properties

Attributes that can be set or retrieved from objects. See [Properties Reference](../properties/README.md) for complete information.

### Methods

Actions that objects can perform. See [Methods Reference](../methods/README.md) for a complete list.

## Getting Started with OLE Automation

To begin using Open Plan's OLE Automation capabilities:

1. [Learn how to access OLE Automation objects](accessing-objects.md)
2. [Understand the object hierarchy](../object-hierarchy/README.md)
3. [Review sample code and examples](#examples)

## Programming Environments

Open Plan OLE Automation objects can be accessed with a variety of programming environments and client applications. The decision of which tool to use is left solely to the user. Deltek's OLE sample code is written in Microsoft's Visual Basic, which is an excellent tool for both beginners and experienced users to create simple, yet powerful, OLE client applications.
